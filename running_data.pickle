S'\n                           It appears that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) hasnt let go of its plans to return in China. According to local media reports, Google registered a shell company in Shanghai back in 2014 under the name of Pengji Information Technology that could very well be an important step by the company to set up shop once again in China.\nAs per details posted on the Shanghai Administration for Industry and Commerce to the Chinese publication, Pengji has Google Ireland Holdings listed as its sole shareholder. Google Ireland Holdings, as the name suggests is a European subsidiary of Alphabet. Pengjis operations, much like Google, extend to search engine service, software based solutions, technology consulting and integration..\nThe company currently has 5 million yuan in registered capital that roughly translates into $780,000. William A. Farris that currently serves as an attorney for Pengji and is based at Googles Beijing office, is named as the head of Pengji.\nIt is still too soon to know Googles plans in this regard for sure, given that the company is yet to make a formal announcement in this matter. Bidness Etc tried to contact Google, but the company was unavailable to issue a comment in this regard.\nNontheless, the situation does present an intriguing situation, considering that the search engine giant has reportedly been trying to make a comeback in China. Google made its exodus from the Mainland over five years ago when the website was blocked by the regions regulatory authorities. The ban came as a result of disagreements with the Chinese government over censorship in the companys search results. Additionally , complaints regarding cyber attacks on Gmail account holders in China also acted as another hurdle for Googles ambitions in the region. With Google out of the country, its market share was subsequently taken up by Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).\nBack in November, Eric Schimdt, Chairman of Alphabet, during a TechCrunch conference in Beijing claimed that in some ways Google never left China to begin with. He added that the company was in contact with its partners in China on a routinely basis. In a way this could be considered true, considering that Google still sells advertisements to China-based companies that are looking to branch out to international markets.\nMoreover, there have also been reports of Google to debut its Play app store in China soon. The company was reported to be in talks with Chinese government officials over the possibility of Googles official app store in the country, only delivering apps approved by the regulatory bodies in the region concerned with the matter. Handsets powered by the Android operating system have proved a hit in the region. Even though Googles own app stores are not available in the region, third party platforms have been making major strides.\nPerhaps Google is aiming to make a second coming in China gradually in a toned down fashion. There is a possibility that this time around the company, instead of using its own brand name, delivers its search engine services under the Pengji banner.                        '

(NASDAQ:MXIM), according to news reported by Bloomberg.\nMaxim Integrated Products shares rallied more than 5% in the regular trading session on Wednesday, taking its market value to $10.9 billion. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) the maker of digital signal processing integrated circuits (ICS), has also showed interest in Maxim Integrated Products previously. However, several analysts on Wall Street believe that the company will not be looking to sell itself unless a very high premium is offered.\nAnalysts at Bernstein have weighed in on Texas Instruments after its potential acquisition talks with Maxim Integrated Products, reiterating an Outperform rating along with a 12-month price target of $62. Bernstein believes that Texas Instruments will be paying a significant premium to acquire Maxim integrated. However, the deal can help Texas Instruments see greater Free Cash Flow and share accretion, with limited risk in the coming quarters.                        '

The earnings per share growth over the next five years will be . Intel Corporation had an earnings per share growth of 24.60% in the last 5 years.\nCurrently the return on equity is 20.30% and its debt to equity is 0.37. Intel Corporation has a total market cap of $ 163985.25, a gross margin of 62.90% while the profit margin is 20.80% and the ROI is 16.00% \n\nPerformance\nThe stats on Intel Corporation are currently as follows.\nThe weekly performance is -0.97%, and the quarterly performance is at 19.68%. The monthly performance is 2.69% and the yearly performance is -3.78%. The performance for Year to Date (YTD) is -1.36%.\nIntel Corporation has earnings per share of $ 2.34 and the earnings per share growth for this year is 22.20%. The ROI is 16.00% and the return on equity for Intel Corporationas stated earlier, is currently at 20.30%.The return on assets (ROA) for Intel Corporation is 12.40%. \nThe earnings per share (EPS) is a direct measure of a companys profit. EPS is calculated by subtracting dividends from profits and dividing it by the total number of shares outstanding.\nThe return on investment (ROI) is the money a company has made or lost on an investment  in simple terms. \nThe return on equity (ROE) measures the companys profitability and the efficiency at which it is generating those profits. ROE is calculated by dividing the total profit by total amount of money invested in the company. \nThe return on assets (ROA) is a very useful indicator that illustrates how profitable a company really is in relation to its total assets. ROA is calculated by dividing the total annual earnings by the companys total assets.\n\nDividends and Price Earnings Ratio\nIntel Corporation has a dividend yield of 2.76%. The price/earnings ratio (P/E) is 14.85 and the forward P/E ratio stands at 14.69. The price to earnings growth is 1.8 and the price to sales growth is 2.97. \nThe price/earnings ratio (P/E) is one of the best known investment valuation indicators. P/E is calculated by dividing the trailing 12 months earnings per share by the present share price. Typically, a high P/E ratio means that the investors are paying more for todays earnings in hopes of future growth in earnings. \nThe forward price to earnings ratio, as the name suggests, is used to find the future price to earnings ratio. It is calculated by dividing the market price per share with the anticipated earnings per share.\nThe price to earnings growth ratio (PEG) is utilized for determining a stocks value in relation to the companys earnings. It helps to provide a more holistic picture with the P/E ratio. The PEG is calculated by dividing the price to earnings ratio by the annual earnings per share growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock is undervalued in relation to its earnings performance. \nVolume\nIntel Corporation has a 52-week low of 41.61% and 52-week high of -4.55%. The company has a 20-day simple moving average of 5.31% and a volume of 5.31%. The average volume stands around 28051.18.\nVolume is the amount of shares that trade hands  in simple terms. \nTechnical\nThe technical stats for Intel Corporation are as follows.\nIntel Corporation has a simple moving average of 5.31% over the last 20 days. The simple moving average for the last 200 days stands at 12.52%. Intel Corporation has a beta of 0.92 and the weekly and monthly volatility stands at 2.08% and 1.90% respectively. \nA simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of the stock for the given time periods, say for 20 days, and then dividing it by that time period- i.e 20. It usually helps to smooth out the noise by filtering out random price movements. Since SMA is based on past data, it will tend to have a lag. The longer the time period the greater the lag. So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. \nBeta is used to measure the volatility of the stock. A beta of less than 1 means that it is less volatile than the market and a beta of greater than 1 means that it is more volatile than the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock will move with the market.\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\nVolatility, in simple terms, is an indicator of how risky the stock is. It is the amount of uncertainty or riskabout the magnitude of changes in a stocks value. Higher volatility means that a stocks price can change radically in either direction in a very short period of time and lower volatility is just the opposite, as the price doesnt change dramatically  instead it varies at a steady pace over a significantly longer period of time. \n\n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and information expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any company stakeholders, financial professionals, or analysts.

S'\n                    In late 2014, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced its very first "phablet" -- the iPhone 6 Plus. Although the smaller iPhone 6 was the more popular of the two (and it\'s very likely that the current iPhone 6s is more popular than the iPhone 6s Plus) overall, there are some very important, high-growth countries such as China in which the larger-screen iPhones are probably more popular.\nIt\'s also worth noting that for models with equivalent storage capacities, Apple charges a full $100 more for the Plus variants of its phones. There\'s little doubt in my mind that Apple would prefer that iPhone customers "buy up" to the larger iPhones than go with the smaller 4.7-inch model.\nTo that end, I believe that investors and consumers alike should expect Apple to increasingly endow the Plus versions of its iPhones with special features and improved specifications relative to the smaller, standard iPhone.\nSo, this is how I think Apple will differentiate the iPhone 7 Plus from the iPhone 7 next year:\nHigher resolution, greater number of pixels per inch For both the iPhone 6/6 Plus and the iPhone 6s/6s Plus pairs, Apple used a much higher-resolution display on the Plus models than it did on the standard models. The iPhone 6/6s used 1334-by-750 resolution displays while the 6s/6s Plus used much higher-resolution 1920-by-1080 displays.\nNot only do the larger phones pack in more pixels by virtue of the fact that they are larger, but the larger phones use displays that cram in more pixels per inch. This means that the displays on the larger phones also appear quite a bit sharper than the displays on the smaller phones.\nI believe that with the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple will deliver a significant improvement in pixel density relative to the displays found on the iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus.\nMy initial thoughts were that Apple would include a 2560-by-1440 display on the iPhone 7 Plus (improving pixels per inch to around 534). However, given that the iPhone 6/6s Plus internally render images at 2208-by-1242 and downscales them to 1920-by-1080, it seems more reasonable to expect that the iPhone 7 will feature a 2208-by-1242 display (462 pixels per inch).\nThis won\'t be quite as sharp as the 2560-by-1440 displays that are commonly found in high-end Android phones today, but it would be a solid improvement over the already razor-sharp 1920-by-1080 panel found in both the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus.\nI also expect Apple to improve the resolution and pixel density found on the standard iPhone 7; it would be nice to see a full 1920-by-1080 display in a 4.7-inch display, but this would result in a display with a greater number of pixels per inch than what I believe the iPhone 7 Plus will sport -- likely a no-go.\nBefore the iPhone 6 launched, there were reports that Apple was testing a display with resolution of 1704-by-960 for the 4.7-inch device. Such a resolution could mean a very nice boost in image sharpness as the number of pixels per inch would move up from "just" 326 to 416, while at the same time making sure that the iPhone 7 Plus is the premium option in terms of pixel density.\nFaster processor to go with that additional memory I don\'t think Apple will design a special variant of its A10 processor for the iPhone 7 Plus. However, it\'s worth noting that the larger (and likely thicker) body of the iPhone 7 Plus relative to the iPhone 7 should allow for increased thermal headroom for the processor.\nIndeed, in Ars Technica\'s testing of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, although both phones were able to sustain essentially peak CPU performance for 10 minutes. The processor inside of the 6s, however, began to throttle over the following 20 minutes, per the review. The chip inside of the 6s Plus, on the other hand, was able to sustain maximum performance "until well past the 20 minute mark."\nFrom these results, it would seem that Apple should be able to increase the peak CPU (and likely graphics) clock speeds on the A10 inside of the iPhone 7 Plus relative to the one inside of the vanilla iPhone 7.\nA boost in peak clock speeds, coupled with the rumored additional gigabyte of RAM in the 7 Plus relative to the 7 (per KGI Securities\' Ming-Chi Kuo), would make the iPhone 7 Plus a clearly faster/higher-performance device.\nAdditional software perks for the larger screen device The iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus devices offer some additional software features relative to their smaller counterparts such as additional functionality in certain apps when the devices are used in "landscape" mode.\nI wouldn\'t be surprised to see Apple add even more iPhone Plus-exclusive software features and functionality in the iPhone 7 Plus and beyond. Although doing so would mean incremental research and development spending, it would probably be well worth it if those features pushed more of Apple\'s installed base to move to the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus models (improving iPhone average selling prices).\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying.

S'\n                    A recent rumor is that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to eliminate the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack in its next-generation iPhones. This rumor stirred up quite a bit of controversy, particularly as the reason cited for Apple\'s removal of the jack was so the iDevice maker could make its next-generation iPhones thinner.\nAlthough this is move would definitely be "Apple-like," I doubt the company will actually go through with it this year. Here\'s why.\nRemoving the jack would be a super risky move At this point, it\'s pretty widely believed Apple will have a hard time delivering year-over-year growth in iPhone shipments during fiscal 2016. It\'s reasonable to assume Apple will want to do everything in its power to return iPhone to growth in the coming fiscal year.\nTo do this, Apple is going to need to put out an extremely innovative and compelling pair of iPhones with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These need to be superior to all previous iPhones in ways that matter to consumers. This includes not making changes that could serve to frustrate/alienate a good chunk of the user base.\nAnd to be perfectly blunt, I think a lot of people use headphones that require the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.\nAlthough there are a number of ways Apple could try to spin the removal of this port as a good thing, and Apple could surely ease the pain by including a 3.5-millimeter-to-Lightning adapter with the phone, such a move seems extremely risky.\nWhat about all of those Beats products that Apple is selling? Another thing to consider is that Apple recently bought headphone maker Beats and is still actively trying to sell Beats products. Though Beats does offer a number of wireless headphones that don\'t require the 3.5-millimeter jack, much of the Beats headphone portfolio does.\nIf Apple were planning on removing the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack from flagship devices slated to launch in about nine months, then it seems strange the company would actively try to market headphones that require it.\nAdditionally, as I perused the Beats website, I wasn\'t able to find a pair of headphones that connect to Apple devices via the Lightning port. Once again, if Apple were planning such a transition, I\'d expect Beats (now under the Apple banner for more than a year) to begin rolling out flagship headphones that connect to iPhone via Lightning.\nApple (probably) doesn\'t need to remove the 3.5-millimeter jack to make the device thinner Finally, it\'s worth noting that Apple probably doesn\'t need to remove the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack in the iPhone 7/7 Plus in order to make the devices significantly thinner. As has been widely noted, the fifth-generation iPod is just 6.1 millimeters thick and includes the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack.\nAlthough I suspect removing the 3.5-millimeter jack would make it easier for Apple to reduce the thickness of its next-generation phones, I\'m not convinced it\'s required.\nIndeed, since Apple pays an army of extremely talented engineers and designers to make its next-generation devices thinner and lighter while at the same time making them more robust, I wouldn\'t bet against Apple\'s teams achieving on the rumored thickness targets (6-6.5 millimeters, per KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo) while retaining the headphone jack.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying.

S"\n                    According to 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is planning to host a product launch event in March. At this event, Gurman reports, Apple plans to show off a next-generation Apple Watch, with shipments said to begin in April.\nGurman says the new 4-inch iPhone, commonly referred to as the iPhone 6c, could also launch at this event.\nThat said, I don't think Apple would host an entire press event just for the Apple Watch and a smaller iPhone. Here's what else I expect (and perhaps hope) to see Apple launch at this event.\nCan we get some new MacBooks, please? Apple launched the 12-inch MacBook, as well as refreshed variants of the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, during its spring 2015 event. Given that most of Apple's MacBooks are all still using Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) older Broadwell processors -- and the 15-inch MacBook Pro is even further behind the times, sporting even older Haswell processors -- these systems should be ripe for upgrades come March.\nIntel is already producing processors based on its Skylake architecture appropriate for refreshes of the 12-inch MacBook, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air systems (should Apple keep these around), so upgrades to these systems seem a given at this point.\nIf Intel is able to produce Skylake processors with Iris Pro graphics in large quantities in support of an early 2015 refresh of the 15-inch MacBook -- and these should be quite large, fairly difficult-to-build processors -- then I'd expect this system to be refreshed as well.\nIf not, then I'd expect all if the MacBooks, save for the 15-inch Pro, to see updates, with the 15-incher getting a makeover a few months later.\nMac Pro is also well overdue for a refresh Another Mac product in serious need of a refresh is the company's high-end Mac Pro computer. The current Mac Pro lineup uses Intel's Ivy Bridge-EP processor family, which is a generation behind what Intel currently sells.\nIntel is expected to launch its next-generation workstation processor family, known as Broadwell-EP, during the first quarter of 2016. This would seem like an opportune time for Apple to update these systems to both new processors -- which should bring significant performance and efficiency enhancements -- and a new, more feature-rich platform.\nHey, how about the iPad Air?  In 2015, Apple updated both the iPad Mini and brought out an entirely new class of iPad, known as the iPad Pro. However, it didn't roll out a new iPad Air.\nIn a bid to boost iPad sales, I think there's a reasonable chance the company will refresh the iPad Air. The iPad Air 2 is still a strong 9.7-inch tablet offering, but there's certainly room to improve the device.\nFor one thing, it would be nice to see the A9X chip that's currently found inside the iPad Pro make its way into a device the size of an iPad Air.\nAdditionally, according to tests performed by website Display Mate, the iPad Air 2 has a display that's inferior to the ones found in both the iPad Mini 4 and the newly released iPad Pro.\nAlthough the iPad Air 2's display is subjectively still quite nice, at least in this author's opinion, a better display -- coupled with other upgraded functionality -- could help persuade users of older iPads to finally upgrade.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone utilities, stockbrokers, record companies, bookstores, travel agencies, and big box retailers did when the Internet swept away their business models. And when cable falters, you don't want to miss out on these 3 companies that are positioned to benefit. Click herefor their names.

S'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was hit hard on Wednesday, and the firms problems may have been a catalyst for a bad day across the entire market. The firms issues on this mornings market appear to be varied, but the focus on three major problems: Apples designphilosophy might be dead, Apples iPhone 6S shipments look weaker, and the firms service division has suffered a major setback.\n\nAt time of writing Apple stock was selling for $115.38, down 2.41 percent for the days trading so far. Its not even a local low for the firm, however, and most of the issues plaguing Apple stockon todays market have been around for quite a while. Heres a look at whats worrying Wall Street.\nApple Inc. loses the run of its design team\nOn Tuesday Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled a minor new product that appears to have had major ramifications for the way the firm is perceived. The $99 Smart Battery Case is a high-priced version of peripherals that third parties have been offering for years. Its a kind of admission on the part of the firm that the battery life in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S isnt up to scratch, and it may mean that the iPhone 7 wont be much better on that front.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nIt is also, in the eyes of many tech commentators, a big mistake in terms of design. The Verge, an outlet normally entranced by the design of Apple products, published a piece entitled What happened to Apple design? on Tuesday. Author Nick Statt decried the design of the battery case, and called it Unapologetically bad.\nHe says that the Steve Jobs-like attention to detail has left Apple and many of the firms new products seem to say,Well, we couldnt really find a better way, so we just went with it. Killian Bell over at Cult of Mac said that the case wasbutt-ugly. Joanna Stern at the Wall Street Journal called the case fairly unsightly, while Chris Valadzco over at Engadget said it was surprising that Apple which supposedly values clean, attractive design would produce a product with such a conspicuous lump in it.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...  Apple Inc. (AAPL) Folly Could Hurt Healthcare Says Ex-DesignerAll of this amounts to a serious question of the firms design philosophy. Is the old Apple dead? Will the firms new devices get worse and worse until theres no difference between an Apple release and just another Huawei smartphone? For now those questions remain unanswered, but the line of questioning shows that Steve Jobs still haunts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock at every turn, despite the absolutely fantastic job Tim Cook has done for shareholders.\nApple Inc. iPhone sales questioned\nThe questions about the future of Apple design come at a time when the firm is besieged by notions that growth across its hardware business is about to stutter. On December 7 IDC said that the world smartphone market would grow by less than 10 percent for the first time this year. The news for Apple was particularly bad.\nThe research firm said it expects Apple to ship a total of 226 million iPhones this year. That, however, models sales of just under 70 million for the fourth quarter. Wall Street will be looking for Apple to sell at least 75 million units in the fourth quarter after it sold 74.5 million units in the same three months of 2014.\nApple stock is going to suffer if the firm doesnt manage to at least match sales from 2014in the fourth quarter, and the chances of that happening are being questioned all over. Pacific Crest says that looking ahead Wall Street as a whole may be overestimating the selling power of the iPhone 6S. In the view of the firm Apple will manage to sell something like 55 million units of the device in the three months through March.\nReports like this are coming in from all over despite the Wall Street consensus that Apple stock is still set for growth in the year ahead. Theres a loot of worry about future sales of the iPhone, and Apple will have to deal with them in a serious way once it reveals its earnings report for the fourth quarter.\nApple stock doesnt know how to grow\nThe worries about sales of the current iPhone, and the design of future products from Apple, can only be answered by some thesis about where the firm is going to go in future. One major story, put succinctly by Brian White of Drexler Hamilton, is that Apple will grow its services division and increase sales by selling more and more kinds of software and media to its hardware base.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...  Apple Inc. (AAPL) Watch Won\'t Ever Be a Medical DeviceThat idea was delivered a major blow on Wednesday morning afterCBS CEO Les Moonves said that the firms plans to launch a full TV service were on hold. According to the exec, who made the comments at the Business Insider conference in New York, Apple has not managed to come to terms with the content providers.\nHe told the gathered crows that Apple and the TC networkshad conversations on it, and I think they pressed the hold button. Mr. Moonves was the one that offered some level of confirmation that Apple was working on a TV service earlier on this year, and hes become a popular indirect source on the progress of the product.\nThe lack of growth into new product categoriesan issue that may hit Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock for weeks and months to come. If Apple iPhone sales are indeed set to slow, and the firm cant come up with anything new, Apple stock is likelyto be hit hard by a lot of growth seekers selling out.\nThat appears to be at least part of whats happening today, though theres no clear indication that the trend will continue. The two really major catalysts coming up for Apple are the firms next earnings report, which is more than a month away, and the Federal Reserves decision next week.\nThe stock market reaction to a rate rise may not be priced in just yet and if Janet Yellen and the rest of the Fed board decide to tighten the money supply, the effect on the market as a whole could outweigh a lot of whats going on individually at the firm level. For now, however, traders are nervous about Apple stock, and given the news of recent weeks, and the volatile cycle that any rate rise risks, they have every right to be.\n\njQuery.ajax({url: "http://learnbonds.com/", data: {top_ten_id: 125579, top_ten_blog_id: 1, activate_counter: 11, top10_rnd: (new Date()).getTime() + "-" + Math.floor(Math.random()*100000)}});'

S'\n                           Mac Rumors reports that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has launched yet another TV ad for its fourth generation Apple TV. The new The Future of Television advertisement gives viewers a tour of the various apps, movies and TV shows available on the device, along with services like Siri.\nAfter the tech giant unveiled its latest Apple TV at its Apple Event 2015, the company has been working increasingly hard to roll out a series of TV promo ads, billboard campaigns, and online advertisements to boost popularity for the device. By using colorful lines with snippets of its various features, Apples latest one-minute promo ad is just another addition to the vast promotional campaign being carried out by the company since October.\nThe Future of Television ad mentions the range of TV shows which are available on the iPhone makers latest offering. These include The Simpsons, Inside Out, Ant Man, Orange is the New Black and Game of Thrones. Coupled with numerous tvOS apps available at the tvOS App Store along with games like Guitar Hero, we believe that the promo works as a great booster for increasing sales for the TV. Since users are mostly inclined towards shows produced by HBO and Amazon, making trending content available may just help lure in a niche market.\nFurthermore, the TV spot ad also unveils how voice-automated Siri operates on the new television set. Accompanied by services like a whole tvOS App Store and search engine, the companys foray into developing a TV set which resembles some functions of its smartphone is a clever way to create an edge against competitors in the market. It is also possible that with the range of TV ads that have been promoting Apples new TV, these promos will serve to increase the usage of Siri which is integrated in the companys line of variants.\nHowever, since the past few Apple ads have also been working hard to secure media personalities like Jamie Foxx and Penelope Cruz, we believe that the companys focus on promoting aspects of the new TV in the new ads is just another strategy. While it is possible that Apple may roll out more ads including celebrities in the future, its latest ad is pretty much a great insight into the TVs diverse capabilities.                        '

S'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)announced that the company achieved a number one market share position for thin clients based on its thin-client shipments. According to its unit sales to thin client customers last year, AMD has more than half of that market, with 53 percent market share.1\nThin clients, with little or no local storage, often serve as intelligent front-ends for server or cloud-based applications. Thin clients using AMD Embedded G-Series have a strong value proposition for immersive graphics in single- or multi-display configurations in the enterprise. Recent design wins with HP, Fujitsu, and Samsung validate that AMD APUs provide compelling value with horsepower for data movement, encryption/decryption of central server data, and even video encode/decode for video conferencing or multimedia streaming.\nThe AMD Embedded G-Series SoC couples high performance compute and graphics capability in a highly integrated low power design, said Scott Aylor, corporate vice president and general manager, AMD Enterprise Solutions. These processors provide compelling performance per dollar per watt, strong security, sophisticated power management, and superior graphics performance. The product lineup includes an unparalleled range of pin- and software-compatible offerings, helping to address multiple needs of our customers.\nAMD G-Series SOC Ideal for Thin Client Applications\nAMD thin client solutions continue to gain market adoption because of the move to cloud-based computing. Increasingly, thin clients are also being used for more complex and high performance tasks. This is especially true for devices incorporating x86 CPUs and sophisticated graphics. The surge of innovation in the desktop virtualization market has created new opportunities for powerful thin clients that are now capable of executing demanding tasks including computer-aided design and 3D modeling. Customers are also using AMD thin client solutions in financial and government services, call centers, kiosks, and hospitals, smart monitors and other multi-user, virtualized installations.\nThe AMD G-Series SoC also features enhanced security for enterprise IT operations, enabling security between the thin client and the server, and allowing only software approved by an enterprises IT organization to run on the thin client device. It also supports enhanced power management technology to help manage energy costs and environmental impact across large deployments.(Original Source)\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices closed yesterday at $2.39, up $0.04 or 1.49%. AMD has a 1-year high of $3.37 and a 1-year low of $1.61. The stocks 50-day moving average is $2.18 and its 200-day moving average is $2.05.\nOn the ratings front, AMDhas been the subject of a number of recent research reports. In a report issued on October 26, Northland Securities analyst Gus Richard reiterated a Buy rating on AMD, with a price target of $5, which represents a potential upside of 109.2% from where the stock is currently trading. Separately, on October 16, Canaccord Genuitys Matt Ramsay reiterated a Hold rating on the stock and has a price target of $2.\nAccording to TipRanks.com, which ranks over 7,500 financial analysts and bloggers to gauge the performance of their past recommendations, Gus Richard and Matt Ramsay have a total average return of 8.6% and 0.9% respectively. Richard has a success rate of 70.6% and is ranked #421 out of 3640 analysts, while Ramsay has a success rate of 57.9% and is ranked #1538.\nThe street is mostly Neutral on AMD stock. Out of 14 analysts who cover the stock, 8 suggest a Hold rating , 3 suggest a Sell and 3 recommend to Buy the stock. The 12-month average price target assigned to the stock is $2.57, which represents a potential upside of 7.5% from where the stock is currently trading.\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc is a semiconductor company with facilities around the world.

Oracle Corporation forecasts a earnings per share growth of -7.10% over the next year. Its return on investment is currently 12.20% and its debt to equity is currently 0.87. Oracle Corporation has a market cap of 165169.12 and its gross margin is 79.80%.\nDividend\nOracle Corporation has a dividend yield of 1.55%. Dividend yield is a ratio that indicates how much a company pays out in dividends, relative to its share price. A high dividend yield ratio is considered anything over 5%, while a very high ratio is considered anything over 10%. This ratio is most commonly expressed as a percentage. The dividend yield essentially measures the amount of money an investor is getting from his or her equity position. Typically a safe bet, high dividend stocks are used by more conservative investors who need a lower cash flow.\nVolume\nHere are the statistics on Oracle Corporations 52-week performance currently. It has a 52 week low of 10.18%, a 52 week high of -16.28%, and a simple moving average of 0.52% over the last 50 days. Its volume is 15825876 with an average volume of 15906.22. Volume is the number of shares traded in either a stock, or an exchange during a set period of time. High activity stocks may mean that something is going on in the company, and are therefore watched more closely by investors. Volume is most simply put, the amount of shares that trade hands.\nPrice to Earnings\nOracle Corporation has a forward P/E of 13.56 and a P/E of 18.18. The P/E of a company is commonly used when comparing current earnings to forecasted future earnings. For example, if a company forecasts future profitability, the estimated P/E will be lower than the current P/E. P/E is calculated by dividing the market price per share by the expected earnings per share, and also referred to as price-to-earnings. Oracle Corporation has a P/S of 4.34 and a P/G of .\n\nTechnical\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\nThe technical numbers for Oracle Corporation are as follows: It has a simple moving average 50 of 0.52%, a 52 week high of -16.28%, and a 52 week low of 10.18%. A simple moving average is calculated by adding the closing price of the security for a number of time periods; then divide the total by that number. Oracle Corporation has a gap of -0.28%.\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and information expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any company stakeholders, financial professionals, or analysts..

The earnings per share growth over the next five years will be . NVIDIA Corporation had an earnings per share growth of 62.50% in the last 5 years.\nCurrently the return on equity is 13.60% and its debt to equity is 0.32. NVIDIA Corporation has a total market cap of $ 18055.28, a gross margin of 56.00% while the profit margin is 12.30% and the ROI is 10.90% \n\nPerformance\nThe stats on NVIDIA Corporation are currently as follows.\nThe weekly performance is 2.47%, and the quarterly performance is at 51.54%. The monthly performance is 6.77% and the yearly performance is 64.02%. The performance for Year to Date (YTD) is 70.16%.\nNVIDIA Corporation has earnings per share of $ 1.07 and the earnings per share growth for this year is 51.40%. The ROI is 10.90% and the return on equity for NVIDIA Corporationas stated earlier, is currently at 13.60%.The return on assets (ROA) for NVIDIA Corporation is 8.40%. \nThe earnings per share (EPS) is a direct measure of a companys profit. EPS is calculated by subtracting dividends from profits and dividing it by the total number of shares outstanding.\nThe return on investment (ROI) is the money a company has made or lost on an investment  in simple terms. \nThe return on equity (ROE) measures the companys profitability and the efficiency at which it is generating those profits. ROE is calculated by dividing the total profit by total amount of money invested in the company. \nThe return on assets (ROA) is a very useful indicator that illustrates how profitable a company really is in relation to its total assets. ROA is calculated by dividing the total annual earnings by the companys total assets.\n\nDividends and Price Earnings Ratio\nNVIDIA Corporation has a dividend yield of 1.37%. The price/earnings ratio (P/E) is 31.36 and the forward P/E ratio stands at 24.82. The price to earnings growth is 7.18 and the price to sales growth is 3.72. \nThe price/earnings ratio (P/E) is one of the best known investment valuation indicators. P/E is calculated by dividing the trailing 12 months earnings per share by the present share price. Typically, a high P/E ratio means that the investors are paying more for todays earnings in hopes of future growth in earnings. \nThe forward price to earnings ratio, as the name suggests, is used to find the future price to earnings ratio. It is calculated by dividing the market price per share with the anticipated earnings per share.\nThe price to earnings growth ratio (PEG) is utilized for determining a stocks value in relation to the companys earnings. It helps to provide a more holistic picture with the P/E ratio. The PEG is calculated by dividing the price to earnings ratio by the annual earnings per share growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock is undervalued in relation to its earnings performance. \nVolume\nNVIDIA Corporation has a 52-week low of 78.47% and 52-week high of -1.66%. The company has a 20-day simple moving average of 14.96% and a volume of 14.96%. The average volume stands around 8768.7.\nVolume is the amount of shares that trade hands  in simple terms. \nTechnical\nThe technical stats for NVIDIA Corporation are as follows.\nNVIDIA Corporation has a simple moving average of 14.96% over the last 20 days. The simple moving average for the last 200 days stands at 42.12%. NVIDIA Corporation has a beta of 1.32 and the weekly and monthly volatility stands at 2.99% and 2.28% respectively. \nA simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of the stock for the given time periods, say for 20 days, and then dividing it by that time period- i.e 20. It usually helps to smooth out the noise by filtering out random price movements. Since SMA is based on past data, it will tend to have a lag. The longer the time period the greater the lag. So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. \nBeta is used to measure the volatility of the stock. A beta of less than 1 means that it is less volatile than the market and a beta of greater than 1 means that it is more volatile than the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock will move with the market.\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\nVolatility, in simple terms, is an indicator of how risky the stock is. It is the amount of uncertainty or riskabout the magnitude of changes in a stocks value. Higher volatility means that a stocks price can change radically in either direction in a very short period of time and lower volatility is just the opposite, as the price doesnt change dramatically  instead it varies at a steady pace over a significantly longer period of time. \n\n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and information expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any company stakeholders, financial professionals, or analysts.

S'\n                    Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is reportedly developing a smartphone version of its Surface tablets called the "Surface Phone,"according to insider sources cited by Windows Central. Surface VP Panos Panay and his team reportedly inherited the project after Microsoft slashed thousands of jobs from Nokia\'s former handset unit earlier this year.\n\nPanos Panay (R) sells the first Surface Book. Source: Microsoft.\nThe device is expected to be powered by an Intel x86 CPU, which means that older Windows software should run on the system. That could be useful for users who want to convert the mobile device into a full-fledged desktop with the new Continuum feature. \nWindows Central estimates that the device could launch in the second half of 2016 to coincide with a large update for Windows 10 code-named Redstone. But will a Surface Phone realistically fare any better than its new flagship Lumia devices at gaining ground against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet\'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google in the high-end smartphone market?\nMicrosoft\'s mobile game plan is falling apartMicrosoft previously approached the mobile market with four key strategies. First, it kept selling Nokia-branded feature phones bundled with Microsoft services to convince first-time smartphone buyers to buy Windows Phones. Second, it launched Windows Phones at lower prices than Android devices to gain market share in emerging markets.\nIt then released Windows 10 Mobile to replace Windows Phone 8 and tether all those devices to a unified ecosystem. Lastly, it launched Continuum to convert its top-tier flagship devices into desktop PCs, which could theoretically convince some iOS and Android users to try Windows 10 Mobile.\nUnfortunately, Google\'s refreshed Android One initiative is nowundercutting Microsoft\'s cheapest Windows Phones with $30 to $50 handsets. Continuum also only works on the Lumia 950 and 950 XL fornow, which severely limits market exposure to Windows 10 Mobile\'s most innovative feature. \nWindows 10 Mobile now accounts for 7% of all Windows Phones, but Microsoft\'s market share continues to shrink. Gartner estimates that Windows Phones only accounted for 1.7% of all smartphone shipments during the third quarter, down from 3% in the prior year quarter.\nBlurring the lines between devicesReleasing a Surface Phone would be in line with Microsoft\'s previous strategies of blurring distinctions between devices. With the Surface, it tried to bridge the gap between PCs and tablets. With a Surface Phone, Microsoft can leverage the Surface brand\'s recognition to blur the distinction between a tablet and a phone. It would also complement Microsoft\'s strategy of expanding the Surface line with new devices like the Surface Book.\nBut with so many device options on the market, many shoppers can\'t decide which devices to replace. Gartner estimates that shipments of all devices (PCs, tablets, ultramobiles, and smartphones) will fall 1% annually to 2.4 billion units this year, due to widespread indecision about replacing devices. But on the bright side, Gartner claims that 44% of current tablet users want to upgrade to "a different device" like a 2-in-1 device or a phablet. Both upgrade paths could benefit Microsoft by fueling sales of 2-in-1 Windows devices or Windows 10 phablets like the Lumia 950 XL and the Surface Phone.\n\nThe new Lumia 950. Source: Microsoft.\nHowever, "replacement indecision" can also hurt Continuum\'s growth since Continuum-enabled devices generally appeal to consumers who want to replace their phone, tablet, and PC with an all-in-one device. If consumers are unwilling to ditch one of those devices, they\'re less likely to buy a top-tier Windows 10 Mobile device as an all-in-one solution. Mobile users who are already locked into Apple or Google\'s ecosystem will also be less willing to switch to Windows 10 Mobile and lose all their digital purchases.\nWhy the Surface Phone will likely failThe success of the Surface Phone depends on the Surface brand remaining strong and key features like Continuum and universal apps gaining mainstream awareness. Unfortunately, Surface sales already fell 26% annually last quarter. New products like the Surface Pro 4 andSurface Book might get the brand\'s growth back on track, but it might not be strong enough to carry a new flagship phone.\nMeanwhile, Apple and Google are also blurring the lines between mobile devices and PCs to their advantage. Apple is challenging the Surface Pro 4 with the iPad Pro, while Google willreportedly merge Chrome OS and Android in the near future. Those moves could enable both companies to expand into Microsoft\'s territory faster than Windows 10 can expand into mobile.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.'

The company launched the first generation of its Surface tablet in 2012 as means to rival Apples iPad range within the booming tablet market. The Surface devices took a while to take off. The companys devices struggled to rake in appeal for some time and many analysts were uncertain whether Microsoft had any place in hardware at all. Fast forward towards the end of 2015, and Microsofts tablets now appear to be outdoing those of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nMicrosoft Surface outdoes Apple iPad\nRecent reports revealed that Surface device sales have surpassed iPad sales online. For a long time, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had held the lead in online tablet sales. However, Microsoft seemed undeterred by its lagging position and kept bring out improved versions of it Surface range year after year.\nThe numbers come from the report 1010data Facts for Ecom Insights, January 2014  October 2015, and were reported on by WinBeta.\nThe popularity of the Surface items arose as the answer to a growing dilemma in consumer electronics. It turns out that many people often found themselves torn between buying a laptop or a tablet. Both items obviously have their perks and drawbacks, and, with the dwindling demand for PCs globally, both items fare roughly the same in desirability.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

The devices were launched as the tablets that could replace your laptop. However, consumers hadnt really taken notice of these laptop/tablet gadgets until around late 2014. Now a report by 1010data Ecom shows that Surface devices had the highest online sales in November.\nThe Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book were launched at the end of October after being announced a month earlier. The devices received a lot of positive reviews which added a lot to the Microsofts upward trend in the hardware segment. The report shows that Apple Inc had dominated U.S. online tablet sales for years up until now. It was compiled from the leading 100 online retailers in the country. Together these online retailers account for 95 percent of online physical product buys.\nResearchers are unsure as yet if the sales spike is the due to an initial launch boom or whether Microsoft tablets are appealing more to consumers.\nThe firm is balancing a number of popular products right now. These include its latest Windows 10 OS, which has seen a record number of installations thus far, its virtual assistance software, Cortana, as well as a few others.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

S'\n          \n              \n      Summary\n    \n        We are puzzled, if not troubled, that Microsoft elected to not disclose even one of three SEC probes we identified from the recent past.\n        \n        For a lot of reasons, this is bad for investors. We explain.\n        \n        This note includes our most recent data on Microsoft as acquired under the Freedom of Information Act.\n        \n    \n  \n\n            \n\n\n              This is one of our Disclosure Insight reports that we use to provide commentary and analysis on public company interactions with investors and with the SEC. They are heavily reliant on our expertise with using the Freedom of Information Act. It was previously published at www.probesreporter.com.Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT)Probes Reporter\'s Perspective:We are puzzled, if not troubled, that Microsoft elected to not disclose even one of three SEC probes we identified from the recent past. For a lot of reasons, this is bad for investors.The Facts:One of Microsoft\'s undisclosed SEC probes ended in October 2014. It was formal, and involved questions related to internal controls and the auditor. Another, also closed, lasted almost two years. We don\'t know what that one was about. The third was/is a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) probe that was first widely reported in mainstream media in early 2013, but never specifically disclosed by the company itself. That one may be ongoing.In April 2015, we wrote of at least two undisclosed SEC investigations of Microsoft. At the time, one was closed and the other was confirmed as ongoing. This was based in part on a letter from the SEC dated 9th March, 2015.About a year earlier, in May 2014, the SEC had similarly confirmed the company\'s involvement in ongoing enforcement proceedings that were undisclosed at the time.The SEC also informed us that "Microsoft Corp. was listed in the search results In the Matter of Microsoft Corp, which opened on August 30, 2012, and closed on July 29, 2014."Later, in a letter dated 4th June, 2015, the SEC informed us, "Research in our database index indicates that Microsoft Corporation was listed in two Matters dated between July 2012 and October 2014."These responses represented a change from July 2012, when the SEC had found no investigative records on this company. We now have six pages of records on two now-closed SEC investigations of Microsoft. We have also assembled data on a third undisclosed SEC investigation of the company. Here\'s what we know.Undisclosed Probe #1: We now have a copy of a formal order of investigation sent to Microsoft on 29th July, 2013. We also have a one-page Case Closing Report showing this investigation ended 7th October, 2014. Excerpts from both are posted below.The formal order shows the SEC was focused on Microsoft\'s internal controls. The SEC specifically spoke to whether the company..."may have taken or may be taking action to coerce, manipulate, mislead, or fraudulently influence the independent public or certified public accountant engaged in the performance of an audit or review of Microsoft\'s financial statements required to be filed with the Commission."The following is an excerpt from the first page of the Formal Order of Investigation the SEC sent to Microsoft on 29th July, 2013 regarding this undisclosed formal SEC investigation.(click to enlarge)Here is a screenshot of the full second page.(click to enlarge)If you\'ve not seen one, SEC Case Closing Reports amount to little more than cover pages for the real reports the SEC adamantly refuses to release on its closed probes. Those are called Case Closing Recommendations. They tell you the reason the investigation was opened, the work performed, and the conclusions reached.(click to enlarge)Just above is the Case Closing Report for this investigation. As you can see, it merely gives name of the investigation and its closing date. However, we do know what this investigation was about because of the formal order of investigation, which was referenced and posted just above.Undisclosed Probe #2: The SEC released to us a separate one-page Case Closing Report dated 30th May, 2014.(click to enlarge)It appears this Case Closing Report related to the probe, which the SEC said, "... opened on August 30, 2012 and closed on July 29, 2014." (Due to internal systems lags and delays, the dates on SEC Case Closing Reports don\'t always synchronize perfectly with what\'s reported to us from searches of their records.)Outside of this, we have no idea what this nearly two-year SEC investigation was about. It too was never disclosed.Undisclosed Probe #3: On 19th March, 2013, The Wall Street Journal ran a story regarding a joint SEC/DOJ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation of Microsoft. See "U.S. Probes Microsoft Bribery Allegations" (you may need a subscription to the Journal to read this).That same day, Microsoft posted its response in a corporate blog generally not prominent to the investing public. See the post "Our Commitment to Compliance."Though initially reported otherwise, the company\'s statement never actually acknowledged the existence of any investigation. In fact, per the FCPA Blog, on 20th March, 2013:"In an email to the FCPA Blog [...] a public relations firm representing Microsoft said, \'Microsoft did not confirm whether these investigations are actually taking place.\'"Company filings were equally silent in this regard. None of the documents or information released to us from the SEC on Microsoft appears related to this investigation; that is, it may still be ongoing, and thus, no records would yet be released.In April 2015, the FCPA Blog continued to list Microsoft as a company that was "subject of an ongoing and unresolved FCPA-related investigation." We do not have data or company disclosures to independently corroborate this statement. The FCPA Blog no longer lists Microsoft, as they recently changed their editorial policy to only include those companies that have disclosed their investigations.Analyst Observations:The consistent and complete absence of disclosures from the company regarding three SEC investigations we found here leaves us concerned, for the following reasons:Microsoft\'s pattern of sitting on SEC probes is a troubling disclosure practice. Certainly, especially as compared to its size, the company may have judged none of the matters needed to be disclosed. Alternatively, this lack of disclosure could reveal a company that holds investors in contempt, views itself as above it all, and/or has a disclosure threshold perhaps much higher than is in investors\' best interests. Using a company blog to dance around an FCPA probe, as we noted above and discuss in greater detail below, suggests it is the latter.At least one of the undisclosed probes was formal and accounting-related. Fortunately, this one lasted only 15 months, which we prefer compared to those that fester on for years. Nonetheless, the unknown exposure this put upon investors is entirely unacceptable. Regardless of what companies think we should know, we believe investors in general want to know when a company in which they are entrusting their hard-earned money has a formal SEC accounting investigation.Microsoft is not being straight with investors by choosing to not tell them about SEC probes. We have reviewed thousands of disclosures related to SEC investigations, internal reviews, and other types of regulatory activity. Based on our expertise and experience, we feel confident in warning investors that there is a lot of information the company is keeping from investors regarding its SEC exposures.By solely using a company blog for speaking to an SEC/DOJ investigation, Microsoft effectively buried a material risk factor. That feels willfully evasive, if not slippery.At a time when the company could easily have acknowledged the existence of the SEC/DOJ\'s FCPA probes, it instead chose to use an out-of-the-way blog to give its response to The Wall Street Journal article. Why did it do that? Further, that obscure blog posting acknowledged nothing. We just don\'t get it. But Microsoft\'s not the first to play this game.One benefit to using obscure places to talk about potentially material exposures is that no one can easily find them later. That may have been Microsoft\'s intention. We saw Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) use a similar ploy over the Christmas holiday in 2013. (See our report "Cisco Systems: High Volume of Undisclosed SEC Activity - Troubling Disclosure Practices" (access to this report is free).Like Microsoft, Cisco asserted its commitment to ethics within an off-the-radar blog posting. What\'s different is Cisco was actually using its blog posting to first disclose a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act probe without making a formal SEC filing announcing the same thing. Worse, the blog post was published at 7:11 pm EST on 23rd December 2013, well after everyone had gone home for the holiday. Nothing showed up on this in Cisco\'s formal SEC filings until the 10-Q filed on 20th February, 2014. Only then did media widely report on the disclosure. One cannot help but wonder why the company chose to do it this way.In a bit of "you\'ve got to be kidding me" irony, the following is a quote from Roxane Marenberg, deputy counsel for Cisco and author of the above-referenced blog post:"Ethics and integrity are part of our DNA and ingrained in our culture and the way we conduct every aspect of our business."Our research suggests using an obscure blog posting worked for Microsoft too. It took quite a bit of effort for even us to track it down.We think Microsoft was wrong to use its own blog to respond to The Wall Street Journal article. It could have - and we say should have - easily made the same announcement via a press release, or even in an 8-K. We also think the company needs to improve its disclosure practices, for reasons we noted here.-------------------------------Message from John: I have been in the industry since 1985 and my firm has been doing this kind of research for over 15 years.

Thanks for reading and following.- JohnBefore you ask a question, or comment, here\'s a few things I invite you to keep in mind.The data you see here is rock-solid. Always, and without exception, if we say a company has an undisclosed SEC probe, we can back it up with a document in black and white on government letterhead provided to us in response to a Freedom of Information Act request we made on that same company. Always, we receive these records directly from the government using our own fully documented efforts. Company statements and disclosures we may quote in our reports come directly from the companies.We research over 2,500 companies a year. Unless it impacts our analysis, we are indifferent to what any company we research makes, sells, or does. We are equally indifferent to who loves the company, who hates it, or why they feel that way. Our goal is to simply give you additional information to consider in making your investment decisions.We prohibit trading in shares of any companies on which we are conducting active research. No one connected with Probes Reporter has securities positions of any kind in this company. No one paid us to research this company, produce this report, or influence the timing of the same.The SEC did not disclose the details on investigations referenced above. The SEC reminds us that its assertion of the law enforcement exemption should not be construed as an indication by the Commission or its staff that any violations of law have occurred with respect to any person, entity, or security.Finally, keep in mind that new SEC investigative activity could theoretically begin or end after the date covered by this latest information, which would not be reflected here.To learn more about basics of SEC investigations, and how we know a company has an undisclosed SEC probe, click here.\n          \n              (function(){\n                   var disclosureHtmlStr = "<div id=\\\'article_body_top\\\' class=\\\'disclosure_top hidden\\\'><div id=\\\'inner_disclosure\\\'><!--googleoff: index--><strong>Disclosure: <\\/strong>I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. <span onclick=\\\'SA.Modules.Article.Disclosure.expand()\\\' id=\\\'more_button\\\' style=\\\'cursor:pointer\\\'><strong>(More...)<\\/strong><\\/span><span id=\\\'business_disclosure\\\' class=\\\'hidden\\\'>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

It was to morph into a holding company called Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL), that held different independent companies.\nAs you know, Google began as a simple search company. But its interests were wide-spread, and 11 years after going public, itfound itself invested in a wide variety of disparate fields: Venture capital, driverless cars,an upstart cable company, and the life sciences division all strayed from its search business.\nYesterday, GOOG announced that its life sciences segment would be organized into an independent company called Verily. As you might expect from a Google offshoot, the company has some interesting and ambitious goals. Heres what investors should know:\nVerily: Understanding Disease on an Individual Level\nFirst and foremost, investors should know that Verilysfinancials wont be broken out in quarterly reports. GOOGs core search business will be broken out, then the rest of Alphabets results.But that doesnt mean Verily wont have an impact on the business.\nGOOGs Verily, which means truly,says its missionis to bring together technology and life sciences to uncover new truths about health and disease.\nIt will operate across four key segments: hardware, software, clinical, and science.\nWhy 2016 Will Be a Monster Year for AAPL Stock\nHardware: The flagship product here is the contact lens with a built-in glucose sensor, aimed at helping those with diabetes keep tabs on their levels throughout the day. Smaller, more powerful, and more convenient devices and tools are the end-goal.\nSoftware: It shouldnt be surprising that GOOGs Verily is software-heavy. This is where the companys vision of understanding why diseases progress differently in different people comes to fruition. Its also the main reason Verily could end up revolutionizing healthcare if its proactive philosophy takes hold. After all, information exists in every aspect of our bodies, GOOG reminds us, and Verily is developing algorithms, platforms, and machine learning techniques to analyze and use those data.\nClinical: This is where GOOG partners with other bigwigs in private industry, government, and academic fields to study the next big thing. Clinical is also pursuing what it calls The Baseline Study, which it describes as a multi-year initiative that aims to identify the traits of a healthy human by closely observing the transition to disease.\nScience: The science team at Verily has some verily lofty goals:\nOur science team is pursuing research that will help us precisely understand the processes that lead to conditions like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. We develop automated experimental and computational systems biology platforms and life sciences tools that provide more information about biological function in health and disease than has ever been available.\nOkay then!\nAt the end of the day, GOOGs Verily is in good hands. CEO Andy Conrad, Ph.D., is former chief scientific officer at LabCorp (LH), and is one of the handful of executives that will benefit from the new Alphabet structure. Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to retain their top brainy talent, and by turning Google into a holding company with a bunch of individual companies run by different CEOs, GOOG is better equipped to do that.\nAdvancements in medicine take time, and given the constraints of testing and FDA compliance, leaps and bounds happen over years, not quarters. But with a bold mindset and a better ability to focus on just life sciences now that Verilys an independent company, investors may soon have to start thinking of GOOG as one part tech company, one part healthcare juggernaut.\nAs of this writing, John Divine did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

To ensure their safety, the firm turned on Safe Browsing by default. alphabet made the reveal in a blog post on Monday.\n\nAlphabet finally shows concern for Android users\nAlphabet says that it has enabled Safe Browsing on over a billion machines running Chrome on desktop. This will keep the users safe from certain types of malware, phishing attacks and other cyber security threats. Safe Browsing is not just limited to web browsing. Alphabet has released the feature as part of Google Play Services, suggesting that in the future, it will come to other in-house apps and services as well.\nUsually, the protection was in the form of a bright red webpage indicating that the URL clicked could be dangerous. Prior to this update, such warning pages were available only to mobile users when they activated the lesser known data compression feature available in the settings panel. Now, it is a stand-alone feature, and whether or not it is activated can be verified from the privacy section in Chromes settings on checking.\nIt is important to note that only for Android phones the said feature is turned on by default. The data compression feature is available on iOS, so users interested in getting the same protection for their iPhone can turn it on.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

This service can be used by the users in three ways. First, a user can save up to 50,000 songs from their personal collection for free. Second, they are also allowed to purchase tracks and to download, which they can keep for forever.\nAnd the third way is music subscription. This is similar to Apple Music or Spotifys monthly membership and costs around $9.99 per month. In South Africa, Google Play Music will cost R49.99 a month or $3.50.

When the firmunveiled its Apple Maps in 2012 it was at the center of many jokes in the tech world. The mapping app was riddled with bugs and was feature poor to boot. The map killed some towns and businesses, it renamed famous landmarks with wrong names, and it gave critics more than enough fodder to fire at.\n\nMany people who bought iPhones soon found out that they were better off using Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG),(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Maps than Apple Maps. In fact, it didnt take long for Google Maps to mark out a strong lead over Apple. Yet, Tim Cookhas been trying hard to catch up with Google in the last three years. The firm has revamped its Map service and it has acquired a number of startups in the mapping space. A news report by AP suggests that Apple Maps has almost kicked out Google Maps from iPhones.\nApple reclaims ground from Google Maps\nApple says its mapping service is now used three times more than Google Maps on iPhones and iPads. The stats shows more than 5 billion map-related requests per week favor Apple Maps at the expense of Google Maps. Alex Mackenzie-Torres, a former Google Maps manager, says of the Apple Map, They really did a great job in a short amount of time Apple has something that few companies have  simplicity in design mixed with high doses of pragmatism and practicality.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

PrivCo analyst Chris Pisarsk notes that Apple has been playing catch up ever since This has resulted in a more urgent and aggressive M&A strategy. The success of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the mapping space can be traced to the heavy spending in R&D and in strategic acquisitions. Since, 2009 Apple has bought about 12 startups in area.\nApple has added a number of features that has given it map an edge over Google Maps. For instance, it has added business listings, traffic, and transit info. The firm has also made it easier for third-party apps such as Yelp and Starbucks apps to integrate Apple Maps. Greg Joswiak, VP of Product Marketing at Apple says, We are fast learners and we are fast at fixing things We learned the maps business incredibly fast.\nApple Maps to become smarter\nLate last month, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed that it has been granted a patent on a public transit app that provides an ETA of public transport. The transit patent is one of the 31 patents that the firm recently secured. Apple has made long strides to catch up with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) the transit feature that it debuts in the iOS 9 trails the turn-by-turn transit directions that Google has earlier unveiled in its maps.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

S'\n                           Venture Beat reports that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) just rolled out its Google Play Music service in South Africa. The service will be priced at $3.50 (R49.99) monthly till January 2016, making it available on Android, the web, and iOS devices.\nGoogle Play Music allows users to browse through a variety of music content; including individual artists, record labels, and a range of music genres. It also enables users to upload nearly 50,000 music tracks to their libraries, allowing access from their other connected devices. Furthermore, the service lets users download any of the 35 million songs available on the platform, whilst offering them a song recommendations feature.\nThe service will resume to its original price after January, charging R59.99 monthly. While the company already has some of its other apps like Google Books and Google Movies available in Africa, this is the first time the company has launched a music streaming service in the area. Considering that the trend of online streaming is on the rise with services like Spotify and Apple Inc.s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Music; it was inevitable that Google would roll out its own streaming platform to remain active against competitors.\nThough the offer is available till January 2016, the tech giant may just secure its South African user base by giving them a whole month of discounted access to their favorite record labels. Since the introductory price of the service is reasonable, Googles marketing strategy may help attract curious music lovers successfully.\nWe believe that this strategy is mainly due to avoid users from turning to services like Apple Music and Tidal, which also provide users with features like Connect and an exclusive experience to interact with their favorite musicians. While Google Play Music has not yet come up with such an option, there are chances that something similar might emerge in the future.\nIt is also apparent that Googles recent strategy to activate its Google Play billing in the region will help support the new music service. Its possible that with the tech giants ways of integrating payment and subscription details with users phone bills, Android users may feel inclined to experiment with the service, due to its convenience factor.

S'\n                           Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has shown remarkable strength against the falling PC market. While shares went down to their 52-week low at $24.87 in August, they have since recovered. Now Intel stock is down just 4% year-to-date, as it trades around $34.8. The chipmaker is one of the few Silicon Valley companies that have fought against the tide, owing a major chunk of its revenues to a range of small businesses it operates.\nThe stagnating PC market was one of the reasons, investors were feeling tense when going into the Investor Day held in November. However, Intel was able to restore investor confidence by the end of the event, with dividend raise and better prospects for 2016. The semiconductor company presented a plan for revenue growth for next year, in order to reverse the declining trend since 2014.\nIntels Altera acquisition was exactly one of the needed changes it brought about in the business strategy. As Internet of Things (IoT) market continues to grow rapidly, Intel will make use of its core competencies, coupled with Alteras field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology to push forward in it. Moreover, it has already revealed what its 3D Xpoint technology-based chip, it launched with the help of Micron, is worth. The chip is revolutionary considering it is cheaper than DRAM and faster than NAND.\nTechnical Analysis Reveal Upside to the Stock\nOur technical analysis on Intel stock reveals that shares are striding higher to challenge the $36.8 peak levels it achieved in December 2014. This is in line with our Elliot wave assessment, as Intel stock found a bottom for the fourth intermediate corrective wave at August 2015 low of $24.87.\n\nAccording to our preferred count, the stock is rising in the fifth (final) intermediate wave to compete the third primary degree impulse initiated from November 2012 low of $17.40. The maximum upside for this wave can extend towards $40.44 and $45.30 price levels before the stock looks set to enter a primary degree correction. Risk becomes more significant if shares dip below $29.56. As such, the current weakness implies an opportunity to go long in the stock, which could likely trade around $40.44, even as much as $45 price levels.                        '

S'\n          \n              \n      Summary\n    \n        Earlier this year Intel was forced to revise guidance downward due to slower-than-anticipated desktop sales.\n        \n        If Intel\'s guidance requires revision, it must be done by December 12, which is the beginning of their quiet period.\n        \n        With Windows 10 and Skylake in the market, Intel could be seeing higher-than-anticipated revenues and be compelled to announce revisions upward to its Q4 and 2015 guidance.\n        \n        Expected Data Center Group performance would likely propel revised guidance upward for a significant breakout of the stock above $35 possibly above $40.\n        \n    \n  \n\n            \n\n\n              2015 has been a slow year for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock. In the first week of January 2015, Intel stock was hovering around $35, right where it\'s hovering this week. The major dips in January, March and June were due to negative announcements related to desktop sales. These negative announcements from Intel were all colored with the idea that Windows 10 and Skylake in the fall would increase PC sales.(click to enlarge)Maybe PC sales are rebounding and maybe Intel revenues are rising. The evidence is starting to lean this direction and it\'s likely that the first substantial news of such a rebound will send Intel stock much higher given the much anticipated growth in DCG sales.We will not know if recent sales increases are enough to drive guidance higher until December 12, the beginning of Intel\'s quiet period. If prior to December 12 Intel has information indicating that revenues or earnings will be substantially different than they guided in October, then Intel will be compelled to announce such a revision publicly as they did in June 2014 (upward) and March 2015 (downward). These two examples show the impact such an announcement can have on stock price. Following the March 2014 revised guidance (positive) Intel stock rose ~20% (from below $30 to above $36). Following the negative guidance revision in March 2015, the stock plummeted ~14% ($33.50 to $29) after already dropping from $36 due to indications of PC sales declines.Note that at the investor meeting in November, Intel was careful to point out that the guidance provided was based on the October guidance... the November restatement of guidance was NOT an update based on sales in October and November.PC Sales HintsAnecdotal information is all we have to go on. Here are some sound bites. Please add more in comments.Skylake is pushing gamer PCs sales due to higher performanceSkylake was later to market than anticipated reducing PC sales growth potentialMicrosoft stores are selling Surface devices which are available with Intel Skylake processors and sales appear strongNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) sales of advanced graphics cards indicates very strong gaming PC sales with Intel processorsInventories are drained and empty, ready for new inventory buildsIntel\'s early ramp of the second Skylake fab in Ireland shows strong demand for SkylakeGartner and IDC forecast a continuing decline in PC sales in 2016 (as of their October 2015 estimates)PCs in the home are still needed for productive work even though smartphones and phablets have replaced PCs that were used just for Internet accessIntel Stock Buyers Ready for Breakout or a DiveThe rise in Intel stock price from $25 in August 2015 to the current $35 has been largely due to anticipation of increased PC sales and strong long-term growth in the DCG as well as non-volatile memory. Continued good news about Data Center Group growth in cloud computing, network virtualization and most recently HPC (high performance computing) has stock buyers primed for higher Intel stock prices. Lack of clear PC sales news is likely the only thing holding Intel stock price at $35.The following chart from Finviz indicates the rising support for Intel stock (PC sales increases and DCG growth) as well as the clear resistance of buyers to pay much over $35 until clear news about PC sales growth is heard. The quickly rising support line indicates that buyers\' expectations are rising quickly in anticipation of DCG growth and PC sales increases. If these expectations are confirmed, the stock is likely to rise quickly above $35, possibly reaching over $40 with a price to earnings ratio still less than Intel\'s historic P/E ratio of 20. If the expectations are not confirmed, the stock is likely to drop significantly.(click to enlarge)Pivotal Week for Intel StockIn addition to news from Intel or generally about PC sales, we also will hear this week (December 10) from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) regarding their earnings. Strong Adobe earnings related to the cloud could help drive Intel higher.By the end of this week Intel stock will likely either see a steep rise in stock as investors anticipate growth in PC and DCG sales are confirmed - or a steep decline if there is no confirmation of growing PC sales. Excitement looms - one way or the other.\n          \n              (function(){\n                   var disclosureHtmlStr = "<div id=\\\'article_body_top\\\' class=\\\'disclosure_top hidden\\\'><div id=\\\'inner_disclosure\\\'><!--googleoff: index--><strong>Disclosure: <\\/strong>I am/we are long INTC. <span onclick=\\\'SA.Modules.Article.Disclosure.expand()\\\' id=\\\'more_button\\\' style=\\\'cursor:pointer\\\'><strong>(More...)<\\/strong><\\/span><span id=\\\'business_disclosure\\\' class=\\\'hidden\\\'>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

S'\n                    In a recent research report from Pacific Crest Securities (via Barron\'s), analyst Andy Hargreaves claims that current sell-side analyst estimates of how many iPhones Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will ship in the coming quarter may be "too high," per his team\'s channel checks.\nIn particular, the Pacific Crest team estimates that Apple has ordered components to support the build of 50 million iPhones during its second fiscal quarter. Such build activity, the analysts note, is "consistent with [fiscal second quarter] sell-in of 55 million units, or slightly more if manufacturing yields are better than expected."\nGiven that this number sits below the analyst\'s own estimates of 59 million, and is likely below what most other sell-side analysts have baked into their models, it would appear on the surface that this is "bad news" for Apple stock.\nWhat\'s interesting, though, is that Hargreaves believes that "buy-side expectations for [fiscal second quarter] iPhone units remain below sell-side." Many investors, per Hargreaves, are already expecting fiscal second quarter iPhone shipments to come in at 55 million, "with some anticipating [fiscal second quarter] units as low as 50 million."\n"While we see risk to sell-side estimates, including our own, we believe Apple is much better positioned to meet buy-side expectations," writes Hargreaves.\nHere\'s why the contents of this seemingly confusing research note could actually be good news for Apple stock.\nWhat the heck are the "buy-side" and the "sell-side"?  I have noticed that many retail investors often confuse the phrase "buy-side" with those bullish on a stock and "sell-side" with those negative on a particular stock (i.e., "buy rating" and "sell rating").\nThat\'s not actually the case.\n"Sell-side analysts," according to an excellent definition given by Investopedia, are analysts that work for either a brokerage firm or a company that "manages individual accounts and makes recommendations to the clients of the firm."\nExamples of such analysts include Andy Hargreaves of Pacific Crest, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray, and the other popular names that you often see in the media associated with stock "downgrades" and "upgrades."\n"Buy-side analysts" on the other hand are usually analysts who work for entities that manage money (think hedge funds and mutual funds). Per Investopedia, these analysts "perform research and make recommendations to the money managers of the fund that employs them."\nWhat does the Pacific Crest note mean, then? What Hargreaves was really saying in his research note is that expectations among those who actually make major investment decisions for iPhone sales are generally lower than those of the analysts whose jobs are to provide research.\nThis is potentially a positive for Apple stock because it suggests that relatively weak iPhone sales (relative to what the sell side is looking for) might already be baked into Apple stock.\nThis means that if Apple "disappoints" relative to sell-side expectations and its forecast for its fiscal second quarter implies iPhone unit shipments of "just" 55 million or so, the stock might not actually fall much, if at all. Additionally, if Apple is able to exceed buy-side estimates (and merely "match" current sell-side estimates), the stock could move upward following earnings.\nTaking a longer-term view ... At this point, I think investor expectation around the current iPhone 6s/6s Plus cycle are fairly low, particularly given how robust the iPhone 6/6 Plus cycle was. I suspect that many longer-term investors will be willing to "forgive" a potential year-over-year decline in iPhone sales in the coming year with the expectation that things will improve in the coming year with the iPhone 7.\nEven if Apple sees a year-over-year decline in iPhone sales for fiscal 2016, the real "tell" will be how Apple does with iPhone 7. With that release, Apple will have the benefit of weaker prior year sales (growth from a lower base is easier to achieve) as well as the tailwinds associated with a brand new phone design.\nAs long as Apple returns to growth during the iPhone 7 cycle, Apple shares should be fine. However, if Apple sees a decline in iPhone shipments during the current fiscal year and sees those declines extend into the coming fiscal year, then investors should start to get worried.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust.

S'\n                    It\'s safe to say Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella\'s "mobile-first" plans have been refined -- to put it mildly -- following the decision to acquire Nokia\'s flailing phone business for $7.2 billion over two years ago. Sales of smartphones, long the bailiwick of industry stalwarts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), weren\'t the answer to Microsoft\'s mobile ambitions.\n"Mobile first" is about getting the new Windows 10 OS into as many devices as possible -- mobile and PC -- along with making Microsoft\'s software product suite compatible with Apple\'s iOS, and Samsung\'s OS of choice, Android. The mobile plan is paying off handsomely, too, as indicated by Microsoft\'s strong Office 365, Dynamics CRM, and Bing search revenue improvements.\nBut hardware hasn\'t been left out of Microsoft\'s mobile plans entirely -- its Surface Pro line-up is a testament to that -- and folks like Apple and Samsung may benefit by what is expected to be a fast-growing market thanks, in large part, to Microsoft.\nJust the facts It\'s no secret that the market for PCs has been declining for some time, and it\'s not likely that trend will change any time soon. Sales of tablets are also expected to continue dropping, by as much as 8.1% this year compared to 2014, according to recent estimates from research company IDC. But the non-smartphone device market has an upside amid the doom and gloom: detachables.\nEven as PCs, smaller screen devices like phablets, and mini-tablets are all expected to lose market share in the coming years, mid-sized detachable device sales are expected to skyrocket in 2016, by more than 75%. As per IDC, mid-sized pseudo-tablets -- a category including the Surface Pro and Apple\'s new iPad Pro -- will make up the largest piece of the market by 2019. What\'s driving that expected sales growth?\nIDC mentions Apple\'s iPad Pro as one reason for such high hopes for the detachable market, although to date, reviews and estimated sales leave much to be desired. Microsoft\'s Surface Pro lineup, however, is experiencing no such problems. In fact, IDC expects Microsoft\'s Windows detachable market share will more than double by 2019. And based on new, estimated sale data, IDC\'s expectations for Microsoft\'s detachable hardware devices growth may prove conservative.\nOff and running It\'s difficult to determine Surface Pro sales specifics given Microsoft\'s decision in Sept. to change its financial reporting, but it appears the "tablet that can replace your laptop" played a key role in limiting the "more personal computing" division\'s decline in revenue to just 16%. Microsoft\'s phone revenue, another component of the unit, dropped a whopping 54% in fiscal 2016\'s Q1. How, then, was Microsoft able to ease the unit\'s pain, despite the precipitous decline in phone revenue?\nAccording to Oct. sales estimates for Microsoft\'s Surface Pro and Apple\'s iPad Pro, all of the positive feedback that\'s been bandied about from industry pundits and consumers since Surface Pro first hit the streets is more than idle chatter. In October, Microsoft\'s Surface Pro accounted for an estimated 45% of online sales, handily beating Apple\'s iPad Pro sales of just 17%.\nOne month is hardly a representative data sample, but it does reinforce the sense that Surface Pro has quickly become a force to be reckoned with. And as Samsung\'s smartphone sales can attest following on the heels of Apple\'s game-changing iPhones, being first to market with a new form factor opens the door to any number of new players. Just as Microsoft\'s Surface Pro, Pro 3, and now the Pro 4, could do for Apple\'s foray into the detachable market.\nWith each new Surface iteration, Microsoft is not only boosting its own mobile-first initiatives, it\'s making a lot of noise that\'s helping to drive one of the fastest-growing device markets on the planet. With that said, as we head into the year of the detachables, a quick note from Microsoft fans to Apple\'s iFaithful is in order: You\'re welcome.\n\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early, in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.\n\n                    \n                '

S"\n                    There are a handful of megacap tech names that exhibit the sort of characteristics buy-and-hold investors would want from the fundamentals of the companies in their portfolios. But not all of these businesses trade at acceptable valuations. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of those rare megacap names with an enduring business model that also looks like an attractive stock. To illustrate just how attractive the stock is, consider several reasonable estimates for the company's long-term earnings-per-share growth against its measly price-to-earnings ratio of 13.\n\nImage source: Apple.\nApple EPS growth potentialLet's look at several scenarios for Apple's earnings in the coming years.\nFirst, consider analyst expectations. Analysts, on average, predict Apple's EPS to increase by a compound average annual growth rate of 15.3% over the next five years. This would put Apple's EPS close to $19 per share in five years, or more than double the tech giant's $9.22 in EPS today. Assuming Apple stock maintains a P/E ratio of 13 in five years -- a conservative ratio for a company that is able to grow its earnings in excess of 15% annually for five years -- the stock would trade at about $245.\nIf this outlook plays out, Apple shareholders' money would more than double, and investors would earn an annualized return of 15.7%. And this calculation doesn't take into account its dividend distributions during this time. The company currently pays out a dividend yield of 1.75%, and it plans to increase its dividend payout every year.\nOr here's another scenario, a far more conservative one: Assume Apple can grow its net income at about 5% annually while it continues to aggressively repurchase shares, resulting in annualized EPS growth of about 10%. Few would suggest this is an overoptimistic prediction. Not only is it a comparatively restrained estimate for Apple's EPS compared to its 43% year-over-year EPS growth during the last 12 months, but it actually undervalues the company's proven history of consistently releasing new products every few years that can move the needle.\nBut even in this scenario, Apple investors will fare well. Assuming the market awards Apple with a P/E ratio of around 12 in five years in this scenario, Apple stock would be trading at about $178, earning investors an annualized return of about 8.5%, excluding the contribution of its annual dividend. Looking out further, if Apple keeps up this growth, its EPS could essentially double in about seven years -- not bad for a proven market leader that trades at just 13 times earnings today.\nDifficult to refute There are certainly bear cases for Apple. Competition could finally make enough inroads on Apple to negatively impact its pricing power; newer products that help the company grow revenue in the coming years may not have as impressive profit margins as its current products; or this could be the peak of the iPhone's popularity, and waning sales of its largest and most profitable business segment could severely impair the company's earnings growth.\n\nImage source: Apple.\nBut Apple's impressive customer loyalty and its wild display of recent growth strongly suggest the company's days of growth aren't coming to an end anytime soon, making these two scenarios not only look possible but highly probable. Indeed, it could be argued that expectations for 10% EPS growth during the next five years is the bear case for Apple stock. In any case, this could very well be the lowest-priced megacap tech stock in the stock market today.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

S'\n                    Although Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently launched the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, the rumor mill is (naturally) focused on what the iDevice maker has planned for next year\'s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.\nSince the two phones will be, in the words of Daring Fireball\'s John Gruber, "new-number iPhones," it is widely expected that they will be substantially redesigned compared to the iPhone 6/6s generation of devices. This fact often invites some very "creative" rumors and speculation.\nIn this article I\'d like to go over three rumors that have cropped up about the device that are most likely bogus.\nNo metal chassis for iPhone 7? According to a post on Weibo, the iPhone 7/7 Plus will move away from using a metal chassis and will instead adopt a new casing material.\nThere\'s a very simple reason that I don\'t buy this rumor. According to DigiTimes, one of Apple\'s top metal casing suppliers, Catcher Technology, is expected to increase its production capacity by 67% this year. The company is also "expected to keep expanding capacity in 2016."\nAlthough Apple isn\'t Catcher Technology\'s only customer, it is surely one of its largest -- if not its largest -- customers. If Apple were planning to move away from metal casings in the iPhone 7/7 Plus, then it seems unlikely that Catcher -- which would be on the brink of losing a substantial amount of business -- would be expanding manufacturing capacity.\nI don\'t think investors should believe this rumor.\nAMOLED display? Per a report claiming that Apple is testing several iPhone prototypes, one of the technologies that the iDevice maker is reportedly considering for the iPhone 7 is an AMOLED display rather than a traditional LCD. It reportedly even has prototype iPhone 7 models with such displays.\nFinding evidence to contradict this particular rumor isn\'t hard.\nIn a recent article, my fellow Foolish colleague Steve Symingtonhighlighted a quote from Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) CFO Sidney Rosenblatt that strongly suggests the iPhone 7 will not come equipped with an OLED display:\n\nRealistically, based upon the number of phones that [Apple sells], [OLED display] capacity won\'t be in the marketplace until 2017 if they decide to do it.\n\nPerhaps Apple has prototype iPhone 7 models with AMOLED displays, but I seriously doubt that such a device is in the running to be the iPhone 7 that actually makes it to shelves.\nUSB Type-C connector? The same report claiming that Apple is testing out AMOLED displays also claimed that the company has prototypes of the next iPhone that implement a USB Type-C port.\nThis rumor doesn\'t make sense; I simply can\'t see Apple ditching its proprietary Lightning connector in favor of a "standard" USB Type-C connector.\nIndeed, the company seems committed to advancing its Lightning port. For example, Ars Technica\'s Andrew Cunningham (via Daring Fireball) confirmed with Apple that the Lightning port on the iPad Pro supports USB 3.0, even though the Lightning cable that ships with the device only supports USB 2.0 speeds.\nAdditionally, there is a substantial installed base of Lighting-based accessories out there, including fairly new ones like the iPhone dock. Although Apple isn\'t the kind of company that would stifle technical/user experience innovation in the name of backward compatibility, ditching Lightning for USB Type-C isn\'t an "innovation" that\'s worth obsoleting millions of Lighting-based accessories.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone utilities, stockbrokers, record companies, bookstores, travel agencies, and big box retailers did when the Internet swept away their business models. And when cable falters, you don\'t want to miss out on these 3 companies that are positioned to benefit. Click herefor their names.

S'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\nApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) surprised the tech world on Tuesday as it revealed its first battery-stretching peripheral. The $99 Smart Battery pack is an admission on the part of the company that the lasting power of the iPhone 6S isnt up to scratch, but it means more than that. Apple isnt likely to simply be making up for its current device, and the release can be used to read into the firms iPhone 7 specs.\n\nApple has been called on for years to stop making phones thinner and start making them last longer. Its not clear that thats the best strategy for the firm to follow, after all sales keep growing with each millimeter the firm shaves off of the smart phone. It is, however, consistently one of the most talked about weaknesses of the device. Apple now has a solution, but it wants yet another $99 for the privilege.\nApple Inc. gets iPhone battery up to scratch\nThe $99 Smart Battery Case is different in design from most of the power add-ons available on the market right now. It holds flush to the case of the actual phone for the most part, only bulging to show off where the battery actually is. It comes in Charcoal Gray or White and works with the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) says that the case will help users to secure increased talk time up to 25 hours, Internet use up to 18 hours on LTE, and even longer audio and video playback. A microfiber lining in the case serves to keep it safe from impact, while a soft elastomer hinge design allows the case to be put on and taken off with ease. In terms of pure specs the Smart Battery Case offers 1,877mAh of extra power on top of the 1810 mAh power pack inside the iPhone 6S.\nThe case has a port that will allow users to use lightning accessories along with it, and it seems to be a decent case for those who want a long battery life. The $99 price tag is a lot higher than some of the other cases on the market, but, as with all peripherals made by Apple itself, it promises higher build quality and assurance that it will work exactly as designed.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...  Apple Inc. (AAPL) Gets Bag-Checking License, Opens Shopping StoreThe Verge, which managed to post an early review of the Smart Battery Case, says that the device doesnt hold up next to its competitors. It doesnt offer quite as much power, and the bump was, at least for Lauren Goode who reviewed the device, a little bit off-putting. Goodes review ends simply from a pure performance and even a design perspective,Apples effort is not the best you can get.\nApple keeps the iPhone 7 specs hidden\nApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on the iPhone 7 specs right now, but the firm has managed to keep tight control on most of the info about the next big smart phone. Most of what weve already seen, with the best info, as always, coming from Ming Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, makes it seem as if the iPhone 7 specs wont surpass the current device on battery life.\nMr. Kuo says that Apple will endeavor to make its next smart phone the thinnest it has ever released. In his view the device will come in at something like 6-6.5mm. That likely means shrinking the power cell size in the iPhone 7 specs in order to reduce the thickness. Once again, many users will need to splash out on an extra case in order to lengthen the battery life on offer.\nWe dont know a lot about the iPhone 7 specs just yet, and most of the rumors weve been furnished with so far have been far from verifiable, or even likely. Todays release is, however, a sign of the way things are going and it looks like Ming Chi Kuo is, once again, right about the design of the iPhone 7.\nJeremy Horwitz over at 9to5Mac was able to cut through the specs and design of the iPhone battery case in order to come to an interesting conclusion. In his view its rare for Apple to make a one-off accessory for a single iPhone and that means that the iPhone 7 specs are likely to come up short in terms of battery life.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...  Apple Inc. (AAPL) Watch Won\'t Ever Be a Medical DeviceMr. Horwitz goes further, saying this is a cash grab. In his view its disappointing that Apple is building deficiencies in battery life into its smart phones and charging its fans to fix those problems with inapt accessories. The fact that it offers its own accessory doesnt really change that, and in fact reinforces the idea that Apple knows exactly whats going on.\nApple looks for $99 more\nThis time around, however, Apple will be ready. On November 10 Ewan Spence, a contributor over on the Forbes network, wrote his predictions for the 4-inch iPhone 7. In his view the device will serve as a minor frustration in order to funnel buyers to more expensive devices. In order to support that view he pointed to the 16GB iPhone, a device which, in his view, does nothing but forces buyers to part with an additional $100 to upgrade.\nIf that really is Apples strategy, and theres lots of reasons to have doubt, then the firms new battery play fits right in. The iPhone 7 is going to be incredibly thin, and its going to have enough battery for a full day, or something close to that. For those who cant charge during the day and sometimes end up using their phone heavily, however, the added battery pack may be a $99 purchase too tempting to avoid at the counter.\nApples iPhone is by far the most important product it has right now in terms of sales and slowing growth rates, and perhaps an end to growth altogether, have made Wall Street nervous. Apple has arrested some of those would-be sellers by driving up the average sales price for the iPhone and ballooning its margins.\nThe iPhone Smart Battery Case may serve to further that goal, at least in some small way, and leave people spending more in order to get the features they want from their smart phone. Its likely, as Mr. Horwitz at 9to5Mac says, that this strategy will extend to the iPhone 7 specs, and Apple has shown its hand on some of the details of its next release.\n\njQuery.ajax({url: "http://learnbonds.com/", data: {top_ten_id: 125549, top_ten_blog_id: 1, activate_counter: 11, top10_rnd: (new Date()).getTime() + "-" + Math.floor(Math.random()*100000)}});'

S'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) never had much success in the field of mapping technology but it appears that the story has changed. When the firmunveiled its Apple Maps in 2012 it was at the center of many jokes in the tech world. The mapping app was riddled with bugs and was feature poor to boot. The map killed some towns and businesses, it renamed famous landmarks with wrong names, and it gave critics more than enough fodder to fire at.\n\nMany people who bought iPhones soon found out that they were better off using Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG),(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Maps than Apple Maps. In fact, it didnt take long for Google Maps to mark out a strong lead over Apple. Yet, Tim Cookhas been trying hard to catch up with Google in the last three years. The firm has revamped its Map service and it has acquired a number of startups in the mapping space. A news report by AP suggests that Apple Maps has almost kicked out Google Maps from iPhones.\nApple reclaims ground from Google Maps\nApple says its mapping service is now used three times more than Google Maps on iPhones and iPads. The stats shows more than 5 billion map-related requests per week favor Apple Maps at the expense of Google Maps. Alex Mackenzie-Torres, a former Google Maps manager, says of the Apple Map, They really did a great job in a short amount of time Apple has something that few companies have  simplicity in design mixed with high doses of pragmatism and practicality.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

PrivCo analyst Chris Pisarsk notes that Apple has been playing catch up ever since This has resulted in a more urgent and aggressive M&A strategy. The success of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the mapping space can be traced to the heavy spending in R&D and in strategic acquisitions. Since, 2009 Apple has bought about 12 startups in area.\nApple has added a number of features that has given it map an edge over Google Maps. For instance, it has added business listings, traffic, and transit info. The firm has also made it easier for third-party apps such as Yelp and Starbucks apps to integrate Apple Maps. Greg Joswiak, VP of Product Marketing at Apple says, We are fast learners and we are fast at fixing things We learned the maps business incredibly fast.\nApple Maps to become smarter\nLate last month, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed that it has been granted a patent on a public transit app that provides an ETA of public transport. The transit patent is one of the 31 patents that the firm recently secured. Apple has made long strides to catch up with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) the transit feature that it debuts in the iOS 9 trails the turn-by-turn transit directions that Google has earlier unveiled in its maps.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

NVIDIA Corporation forecasts a earnings per share growth of 51.40% over the next year. Its return on investment is currently 10.90% and its debt to equity is currently 0.32. NVIDIA Corporation has a market cap of 17813.18 and its gross margin is 56.00%.\nDividend\nNVIDIA Corporation has a dividend yield of 1.39%. Dividend yield is a ratio that indicates how much a company pays out in dividends, relative to its share price. A high dividend yield ratio is considered anything over 5%, while a very high ratio is considered anything over 10%. This ratio is most commonly expressed as a percentage. The dividend yield essentially measures the amount of money an investor is getting from his or her equity position. Typically a safe bet, high dividend stocks are used by more conservative investors who need a lower cash flow.\nVolume\nHere are the statistics on NVIDIA Corporations 52-week performance currently. It has a 52 week low of 80.59%, a 52 week high of -0.49%, and a simple moving average of 17.16% over the last 50 days. Its volume is 5119335 with an average volume of 8738.89. Volume is the number of shares traded in either a stock, or an exchange during a set period of time. High activity stocks may mean that something is going on in the company, and are therefore watched more closely by investors. Volume is most simply put, the amount of shares that trade hands.\nPrice to Earnings\nNVIDIA Corporation has a forward P/E of 24.49 and a P/E of 30.94. The P/E of a company is commonly used when comparing current earnings to forecasted future earnings. For example, if a company forecasts future profitability, the estimated P/E will be lower than the current P/E. P/E is calculated by dividing the market price per share by the expected earnings per share, and also referred to as price-to-earnings. NVIDIA Corporation has a P/S of 3.67 and a P/G of .\n\nTechnical\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\nThe technical numbers for NVIDIA Corporation are as follows: It has a simple moving average 50 of 17.16%, a 52 week high of -0.49%, and a 52 week low of 80.59%. A simple moving average is calculated by adding the closing price of the security for a number of time periods; then divide the total by that number.

S'\n                    It\'s safe to say Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella\'s "mobile-first" plans have been refined -- to put it mildly -- following the decision to acquire Nokia\'s flailing phone business for $7.2 billion over two years ago. Sales of smartphones, long the bailiwick of industry stalwarts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), weren\'t the answer to Microsoft\'s mobile ambitions.\n"Mobile first" is about getting the new Windows 10 OS into as many devices as possible -- mobile and PC -- along with making Microsoft\'s software product suite compatible with Apple\'s iOS, and Samsung\'s OS of choice, Android. The mobile plan is paying off handsomely, too, as indicated by Microsoft\'s strong Office 365, Dynamics CRM, and Bing search revenue improvements.\nBut hardware hasn\'t been left out of Microsoft\'s mobile plans entirely -- its Surface Pro line-up is a testament to that -- and folks like Apple and Samsung may benefit by what is expected to be a fast-growing market thanks, in large part, to Microsoft.\nJust the facts It\'s no secret that the market for PCs has been declining for some time, and it\'s not likely that trend will change any time soon. Sales of tablets are also expected to continue dropping, by as much as 8.1% this year compared to 2014, according to recent estimates from research company IDC. But the non-smartphone device market has an upside amid the doom and gloom: detachables.\nEven as PCs, smaller screen devices like phablets, and mini-tablets are all expected to lose market share in the coming years, mid-sized detachable device sales are expected to skyrocket in 2016, by more than 75%. As per IDC, mid-sized pseudo-tablets -- a category including the Surface Pro and Apple\'s new iPad Pro -- will make up the largest piece of the market by 2019. What\'s driving that expected sales growth?\nIDC mentions Apple\'s iPad Pro as one reason for such high hopes for the detachable market, although to date, reviews and estimated sales leave much to be desired. Microsoft\'s Surface Pro lineup, however, is experiencing no such problems. In fact, IDC expects Microsoft\'s Windows detachable market share will more than double by 2019. And based on new, estimated sale data, IDC\'s expectations for Microsoft\'s detachable hardware devices growth may prove conservative.\nOff and running It\'s difficult to determine Surface Pro sales specifics given Microsoft\'s decision in Sept. to change its financial reporting, but it appears the "tablet that can replace your laptop" played a key role in limiting the "more personal computing" division\'s decline in revenue to just 16%. Microsoft\'s phone revenue, another component of the unit, dropped a whopping 54% in fiscal 2016\'s Q1. How, then, was Microsoft able to ease the unit\'s pain, despite the precipitous decline in phone revenue?\nAccording to Oct. sales estimates for Microsoft\'s Surface Pro and Apple\'s iPad Pro, all of the positive feedback that\'s been bandied about from industry pundits and consumers since Surface Pro first hit the streets is more than idle chatter. In October, Microsoft\'s Surface Pro accounted for an estimated 45% of online sales, handily beating Apple\'s iPad Pro sales of just 17%.\nOne month is hardly a representative data sample, but it does reinforce the sense that Surface Pro has quickly become a force to be reckoned with. And as Samsung\'s smartphone sales can attest following on the heels of Apple\'s game-changing iPhones, being first to market with a new form factor opens the door to any number of new players. Just as Microsoft\'s Surface Pro, Pro 3, and now the Pro 4, could do for Apple\'s foray into the detachable market.\nWith each new Surface iteration, Microsoft is not only boosting its own mobile-first initiatives, it\'s making a lot of noise that\'s helping to drive one of the fastest-growing device markets on the planet. With that said, as we head into the year of the detachables, a quick note from Microsoft fans to Apple\'s iFaithful is in order: You\'re welcome.\n\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early, in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.\n\n                    \n                '

S'\n                    Microsoft\'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows Phones account for less than 3% of smartphones worldwide, according to research company IDC. Within that market, the aging Lumia 520, which was launched in April 2013, is still the most popular device. The low-end handset still accounts for nearly 15% of the Windows Phone market, according to AdDuplex\'s November numbers. The second most popular device is the Lumia 535, which launched the following year and controls nearly 11% of the market. \n\nThe Lumia 520. Image source: Microsoft.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft\'s mid-range and high-end Lumia devices remain far less popular, with single-digit shares of the market. How will this split between low-end and high-end devices influence Microsoft\'s mobile efforts in the future?\nWhy the Lumia 520 is so popularMicrosoft initially launched the Lumia 520 for $100, but slashed its price to $50 during its first holiday season. Reliable $50 smartphones weren\'t common two years ago, and the 520 proved popular in emerging markets like India.\nThe Lumia 520 helped Microsoft enter a niche market that iPhones and Android devices couldn\'t reach. Alphabet\'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google only recently announced that it would work with OEMs to reduce the average price of their Android One devices from$100 to $50.\nThe Lumia 520\'s share of the Windows Phone market has fallen 10 percentage points from last November, but most of those users seem to have switched to the 535, which launched for about $140 in India. Today, the device costsless than $100 on Indian e-commerce site FlipKart.\nA blessing and a curseThe popularity of Microsoft\'s low-end Windows Phones is a double-edged sword. On one hand, Microsoft can use these devices to expand its ecosystem in developing and emerging markets. As average incomes in those markets rise, those users might subscribe to more cloud-based services or buy pricier Windows 10 Mobile devices.\nBut on the other hand, the Lumia 520 isn\'t on Microsoft\'s list of devices that will receive the Windows 10 Mobile upgrade, which will tether more mobile users to its "One Windows" ecosystem. Yet other cheap handsets like the 535, 430, and 435 have been cleared to run the newest OS.\nHowever, none of those devices meet the minimum requirements to runContinuum, the Windows 10 feature that converts a Windows 10 Mobile phone into a full desktop PC via a $99 Display Box. Instead, Continuum currently only works on the high-end Lumia 950 and 950 XL, which respectively cost $549 and $649.\n\nImage source: Microsoft.\nContinuum is arguably Windows 10 Mobile\'s most game-changing feature, and it could be attractive to emerging-market users looking for an all-in-one device to replace both their PCs and mobile devices. But many consumers might not even notice the feature, since the 950 and 950 XL face stiff competition from iPhones and high-end Android devices. If Microsoft\'s low-end devices continue outselling its high-end ones, a large portion of the Windows Phone market could completely overlook Windows 10\'s best feature.\nGoogle, not Microsoft, will kill the 520Microsoft gained some early momentum with the 520 and its low-end successors, but its overall mobile market share hasn\'t actually improved. That\'s why Microsoft cut thousands of jobs from Nokia\'s former handset division and limited its smartphone launches to just six devices per year.\nWhile that move cuts costs, it also leaves a smaller pool of low-end devices vulnerable to Google\'s cheaper Android One devices. Other low-cost Android devices like the SWIPE Konnect 3 and Kenxinda K528, which both cost less than $30, are already undercutting Microsoft\'s cheapest smartphones. \nGoogle\'s rapid advance into this market could lure away lots of Windows Phone users with its larger ecosystem of mobile services and apps. If Microsoft loses the low-end market to Google before it releases Windows 10 Mobile on those devices, its entire mobile strategy could collapse.\nMicrosoft is running out of timeMicrosoft\'s best hope at a mobile comeback is to blur the lines between PCs and smartphones with Windows 10 features like universal apps and Continuum.\nUnfortunately, the high-end devices that can run all of those features will struggle to gain ground against iOS and Android, while the more popular low-end devices will run into hardware bottlenecks and competition from cheaper Android devices. As a result, Microsoft could lose the low-end Windows Phone market to Android, which will cause its market share to evaporate.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

S'\n          \n              \n      Summary\n    \n        The risk in owning Microsoft at this point is simply the risk of a broad market selloff.\n        \n        If that is something that concerns you, consider putting on a stop loss.\n        \n        But given that Microsoft\'s reinvention is still in the early stages, I certainly wouldn\'t be in any hurry to sell.\n        \n    \n  \n\n            \n\n\n              In a year in which the S&P 500 has ground sideways, stodgy, old Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) - the big tech company everyone used to love to hate - has quietly been hitting new 52-week highs and is up nearly 20% year to date.Sure, that\'s nothing compared to Google/Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is up by nearly half. But Microsoft\'s stock is beating the pants off of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is barely up 5% in 2015.Softy is back, and CEO Satya Nadella is steering the company in the right direction with his "mobile first, cloud first" strategy. But with Microsoft\'s shares now trading for 37 times earnings, has the stock price lost touch with reality? After all, this is a company whose iconic product - the Windows operating system - is tied to a declining PC market.Let\'s take a look.Microsoft Stock by the NumbersTo start, while Microsoft\'s stock\'s current price-to-earnings ratio might look a little on the pricey side, that\'s partly due to the bath it took in its fiscal fourth quarter. Microsoft took a $7.5 billion writedown on its deal with Nokia, which depressed earnings for the quarter and for the entire year. Looking at next year\'s expected earnings, Microsoft\'s stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 20. While that is not "cheap" per se, it\'s in line with the forward P/E of 18 for the S&P 500.Revenue growth has been disappointing over the past two quarters (looking at a rolling-twelve-month tally), but this is in part due to Microsoft\'s transition to a subscription-based model.For example, Office users traditionally bought a licensed copy in a single one-time payment. But today, Office 365 users pay a low monthly subscription fee. The result is that current revenues appear lower even while the quality of revenues has improved, as a subscription-based model creates regular, recurring payments. Microsoft estimates that this will ultimately bring in 80% more revenue per customer, though it will take time to fully work out.Microsoft\'s decision to give Windows 10 away for free to existing Windows 7 and Windows 8 users also has taken its toll on revenue growth. While probably a smart move in the long run, as it helps to put the Windows 8 debacle in the past, it still takes a bite of out today\'s revenues.PC sales also will probably stage a modest recovery from their current depressed levels as companies replace aging machines.But the bigger news for Microsoft bulls is that, under Nadella, Microsoft continues to move beyond the Windows platform. Microsoft (along with Alphabet and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)) is emerging as a leader in cloud services. The cloud-based Azure platform saw its revenues jump 135% last quarter. Revenues from the Intelligent Cloud division, at $5.9 billion last quarter, are quickly catching up to its Productivity and Business Processes division. This unit - which includes Microsoft Office - earned $6.3 billion last quarter.Although Microsoft\'s stock yields only 2.7% at current prices, it has become something of a favorite among dividend investors due to MSFT\'s great track record of raising the dividend. In September, MSFT announced a 16% dividend hike, and the company has grown its dividend at a 19% annual clip over the past three years.Given that Microsoft has nearly $100 billion in cash and equivalents, I\'d say odds are good that growth will continue.Bottom Line for MSFT StockSo, what\'s the verdict? Is Microsoft\'s stock, despite its run up, still a buy?Absolutely.The risk in owning Microsoft at this point is simply the risk of a broad market selloff. If that is something that concerns you, consider putting on a stop loss.But given that Microsoft\'s reinvention is still in the early stages, I certainly wouldn\'t be in any hurry to sell.Original articleDisclaimer: This site is for informational purposes only and should not be considered specific investment advice or as a solicitation to buy or sell any securities.

S'\n                    Windows 10 logo. Photo: Microsoft\nMore than 110 million devices are powered by Microsoft\'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) latest operating system, Windows 10 -- and that\'s a problem for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Windows 10 includes deep integration with Microsoft\'s search engine, Bing. Although Bing remains in a distant second place behind Alphabet\'s Google, the launch of Windows 10 is already having a positive affect on Microsoft\'s search business. As Windows 10 sees greater adoption, that trend should continue.\nBing finally achieves profitabilityFor most of its history, Bing has been a source of red ink and heavy criticism. In 2011, Bing was burning the Redmond tech giant for around $1 billion per quarter. Some, including hedge fund manager David Einhorn, encouraged Microsoft to sell it. But over the last four years, the situation has changed drastically, and last quarter (for the first time) Bing achieved profitability. According to management, it wasn\'t a fluke. "We expect Bing\'s strong trajectory to continue, remaining profitable for the remainder of the [fiscal] year," said CFO Amy Hood on Microsoft\'s most recent earnings call.\nThat profitability has been driven by greater usage. Bing\'s share of the U.S. search market rose to 20.7% last quarter, up from 19.8% in February. According to analytics firm comScore, Bing\'s share rose another 0.1% last month, hitting 20.8% in October. Alphabet\'s Google, meanwhile, has seen its share of the U.S. desktop search market fall modestly over the same period of time -- from 64.5% in February to 63.9% in October.\nWhat Microsoft can do to take more shareIn its earnings slides, Microsoft identified Windows 10 as being the primary catalyst for Bing\'s profitability. By default, the Windows 10 browser, Microsoft Edge, directs users to Bing. The same was true of Microsoft\'s former browser, Internet Explorer, but Edge also includes Microsoft\'s digital personal assistant, Cortana, which relies on Bing. Moreover, Microsoftexplicitly discouragesWindows 10 users from downloading rival browsers that may rely on other search engines.\nMore importantly, the Windows 10 taskbar includes a search field that\'s powered by Cortana (and by extension Bing). "[Bing was]helped by Windows 10 users asking Cortana more than 1 billion questions," said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Microsoft\'s earnings call.\nWindows 10 has enjoyed rapid adoption since it launched in late July, but there are still hundreds of millions of additional PCs that could be upgraded to Windows 10 in the months and years ahead. The total number of installed PCs is around 1.5 billion, giving Windows 10 a penetration rate of under 10%.\nMicrosoft plans to bring Cortana to its Xbox One video game console next year, which should drive additionalincrementalsearchqueries.It\'s also in the process of testing Cortana apps for iOS and Android. Using a singleWindows account, iPhone and Android handset owners can link Cortana on their mobile phones to Cortana on their Windows PC. That utility could bring greater Cortana usage, and drive more search traffic to Bing.\nA new operating system for traditional PCsMicrosoft isn\'t forcing Windows 10 users to take advantage of Cortana or to use Bing -- they can still turn to Alphabet\'s Google. Given that Google still controls around two-thirds of the U.S. desktop search market, many likely are. But Windows 10 remains a threat to Alphabet\'s business. Mobile computing is increasingly dominant, but around half of Google search queries still originate on the desktop, and desktop ads remain more lucrative.\nIn October, Re/code reported that Alphabet plans to introduce a version of Android designed for traditional PCs next year. Alphabet\'s Chrome OS has attracted significant attention, but has failed to gain mainstream acceptance. Android-powered PCs could challenge Windows 10 for desktop dominance, and limit Microsoft\'s search gains.\nIn total, Bing generated just over $1 billion for Microsoft last quarter -- less than 5% of its adjusted quarterly revenue. But the steady evolution of Bing -- from notorious money pit to profit-driver -- is one of the more intriguing aspects of Microsoft\'s business. It likely won\'t dethrone Alphabet in the search space, but Windows 10 is slowly making Bing a legitimate contender.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The first problem is that it cant seem to make its cars as fast as it sells them  youll have to wait for at least a year before you can get a Model X. The second problem is that the firm is having trouble hiring new engineers faster than it fires/loses them. 9to5Google reports that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) auto has poached away the brain behind the creation of Teslas autopilot and a key player in ELon Musks SpaceX.\nTesla Motors Inc Model S factory line\nTesla Motors cried out about its need for talent to work on its cars about two weeks ago. CEO Elon Musk, took to Twitter to throw open the next round of hiring spree at the firm. He noted that the firm wanted to hire experts in autopilot software as it tries to push the evolution of its driver-assist system to become fully autonomous car systems in the not too distant future. It was noted that Tesla Motors has also lost its fair share of talents to rivals such as Appleand more recently, Faraday Futures.\nRobert Rose leaves Tesla Motors\n\nNews has it that Google has hired Robert Rose who was the brain behind the creation of Tesla Motors autopilot and a key player in Elon Musks SpaceX.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

He led the autopilot team to release v7.0 update. His position at Google is not yet defined but his LinkedIn profile says he is a Software Engineer at Google Robotics. Alphabet has been pushing its self-driving car project for a public debut by 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nFrom Tesla to Apple to Google, poaching talent is part of the game\nTo start with, the fastest route to creating the self-driving cars of the future will require full collaboration from all the key players in the market. Tesla Motors knows how to make EVs and it has decent autopilot features. Google has a fleet of full autonomous cars, but it doesnt have a production plant to scale and it cars still drive slowly at 25mph. Apple is tight-lipped about what it has done in the space, but we can rightly posit that the firm has a handle on design and car infotainment systems.\nSince all the players in the self-driving space have refused to work as a team officially; poaching workers the best way to learn from one another without engaging in corporate espionage. Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) seems to make the loudest noise about the loss of its engineers to rival players in the self-driving car race. Truth be told, Tesla is as guilty of poaching key talent as the other firms are guilty of luring away its workers. Apple steals workers from Tesla, Tesla poaches workers from Apple, and Google has a number of steals to its credit.\n\njQuery.ajax({url: "http://learnbonds.com/", data: {top_ten_id: 125334, top_ten_blog_id: 1, activate_counter: 11, top10_rnd: (new Date()).getTime() + "-" + Math.floor(Math.random()*100000)}});'

S"\n                           The notion that large cap companies become more value-based than growth-based has not affected Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) growth in recent times. Shares of the search engine giant surged 2.61% in trading today, at $782.94, an all-time high. The shares value has grown 44% since January this year.\nAt the same time, RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney believes this growth could continue long-term and reach $1000 valuation per share, despite his price target still standing at $880. Though his estimate may seem conflicting at first, it could mean that $1000 valuation is foreseeable, while price targets stand usually within a 12-month period.\nGoogle went under a set of corporate restructurings in August and September, through which Alphabet Inc. emerged. From the said restructuring, the picture suddenly became very clear for investors. Each of the company's operating business segments became more transparent, allowing more room for its core business to breathe and grow.\nIts not just the added transparency that has benefitted the company. Googles core business has kept on booming, reporting an impressive organic growth within 17%-23% year-over-year (YoY) range each quarter for three years in a row, despite extrapolated annual revenues of over $70 billion.\nMoreover, its side businesses, YouTube and Google Play, are all accelerating at growth rates of over 40%. YouTube is expected to generate $7 billion in 2015 revenues, while Google Play is expected to generate $4 billion. Along with close to 50% operating margins the company maintains for its core business, Search and Advertisement, the above segments are likely to help it sustain high growth rates.\nMeanwhile, the company is focusing its efforts on the cloud platform, with the recent appointment of Diane Greene as Vice President proving just that. Google recently acquired Bebop in this regard, and Pacific Crest analysts believe this is the most significant acquisition it has made till date, strategically speaking, since it acquired Motorola back in 2011. Google has for some time faced some turmoil in its cloud business, underperforming in relation to both Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, the latest set of announcements proves it is ready to take on Amazon and Microsoft directly.\nThe cloud market could soon be worth $1.2 trillion in total addressable market (TAM), and $763 billion in serviceable available market (SAM). Even if Google manages to achieve a 1% share, that means it could add a $7.6 billion in revenues, which is enough to move the needle.\nThe company has a great opportunity to dig some value from its other bets, which includes Nest, Google Fiber, the Google Capital and Google Ventures investments. Both Nest, and Google Fiber have business models already in place to generate over $1 billion in revenues.                        "

S'\n                           Alphabet Incs (NASDAQ:GOOG) latest appointment, former Tesla automobile engineer Robert Rose, is unlikely to work on the Google Self Driving Car (SDC) project, reports Business Insider. It is unclear exactly what projects he will focus on, but he was known to be within Tesla CEO Elon Musks close circles, and therefore brings in high quality expertise at Alphabets disposal. These credentials may see him eventually lead the robotics division.\nMr. Rose recently joined Google Robotics, after working at SpaceX for almost six years. He also served a brief stint at Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) this year, where he worked on Autopilot V7.0 feature. This had fueled speculation that he will utilize his technical expertise in developing Alphabets autonomous driving technology.\nSelf-driving vehicles incorporate robotics technology, and although Mr. Roses profile matches the car divisions requirements, his focus seems to be elsewhere.\nHowever, he may serve as more than just an engineer, and can be a candidate to head Google Robotics. The division has been without any serious leadership since the departure of former head Andy Rubin last year. Alphabet CEO Larry Page recently searched for viable candidates to fill in this vacant position. However, attempts to woo Autodesk CEO Carl Bass to manage Googles tangled group of moonshot robotics projects proved unsuccessful.\nOne of the reasons the appointment fell through may have been over the amount of control Mr.Bass would be allowed to exercise on the robotics division. Perhaps Mr. Rose now fits the bill for this position. He is not a former CEO, and is less likely to demand greater freedom, instead preferring to work through collaboration with the top management.\nMr. Rose also served as the director of flight software at Space X. He may contribute to the flight programming and maneuvering of "WiFi beaming clouds" under Alphabets Project Loon in Indonesia. However, at this point its mere speculation, as there has been no official statement or confirmation by the company on its latest appointment.                        '

The firm has been the first to come up with many new features, and this is despite the fact it does not believe in spending too much on R&D.\n\nLow on R&D, big on innovation\nApple does have few weak areas such as Apple Music that did not perform as well as expected, but if we talk of certain features such as implementing 64-bit chip in phones, making use of touch-based tech for creating new ways of interacting such as 3D Touch, and use of biometrics, then Apple is ahead of its rivals.\nDespite all this, Apples spending on R&D is less than that of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and many other major players in the tech world. Apple does not believe in spending all that much money on R&D, though the number has risen in recent years, says a report from Bloomberg Businessweek.\nGoogle, Qualcomm and Facebook spend 15 percent, 22 percent and 21 percent of their revenue on R&D respectively, whereas Apple spends just 3.5%. Currently, Apples spending on R&D is $8.1bn a year.

S"\n                           Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) will introduce new entry-level PC processors in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2016 despite the prevalent weakness in the PC market, according to recent reports by Digitimes. Intel's shares have been on a downward trend since the start of fiscal year 2015 (FY15) primarily due to the weak demand for PCs. In late August, the stock fizzled down to its 52-week low of $24.87.\nThe downturn in the overall PC market has urged the chip maker to seek other revenue streams as a result of which Intel acquired a programmable chip maker, Altera Corporation. Moreover, Intel has also made strides in the manufacture of memory chips. It launched 3D Xpoint technology alongside Micron technology. Wall Street analysts consider Intel's upcoming 3D Xpoint technology to be revolutionary and are hence bullish over it.\nDespite the soft PC market, demand for mini PCs and gaming notebooks has remained strong, especially those equipped with Intels entry-level processors. The chip maker is already expected to roll out its Apollo Lake processors in the second half of FY16 along with several entry-level PC offerings which are to follow after another two months. The company plans to make gains from the deteriorating PC market with inexpensive and mini PCs powered by entry-level processors much like Pentium and Celeron.\nIntel has also recently rewarded its shareholders through healthy reports at its annual analysts day. The company managed to restore investor confidence with the announcement of a hike in quarterly cash dividends as well as its full-year 2016 outlook. Furthermore, Intel has announced that it will spend more than $5.5 billion to convert its old factory in China to manufacture its 3D NAND technology. Intel Corporation stock is up by 0.23% to trade at $34.77 in today's pre-market trade.                        "

Intel Corporation forecasts a earnings per share growth of 22.20% over the next year. Its return on investment is currently 16.00% and its debt to equity is currently 0.37. Intel Corporation has a market cap of 164079.63 and its gross margin is 62.90%.\nDividend\nIntel Corporation has a dividend yield of 2.76%. Dividend yield is a ratio that indicates how much a company pays out in dividends, relative to its share price. A high dividend yield ratio is considered anything over 5%, while a very high ratio is considered anything over 10%. This ratio is most commonly expressed as a percentage. The dividend yield essentially measures the amount of money an investor is getting from his or her equity position. Typically a safe bet, high dividend stocks are used by more conservative investors who need a lower cash flow.\nVolume\nHere are the statistics on Intel Corporations 52-week performance currently. It has a 52 week low of 40.79%, a 52 week high of -5.50%, and a simple moving average of 7.50% over the last 50 days. Its volume is 20207313 with an average volume of 29813.08. Volume is the number of shares traded in either a stock, or an exchange during a set period of time. High activity stocks may mean that something is going on in the company, and are therefore watched more closely by investors. Volume is most simply put, the amount of shares that trade hands.\nPrice to Earnings\nIntel Corporation has a forward P/E of 14.7 and a P/E of 14.86. The P/E of a company is commonly used when comparing current earnings to forecasted future earnings. For example, if a company forecasts future profitability, the estimated P/E will be lower than the current P/E. P/E is calculated by dividing the market price per share by the expected earnings per share, and also referred to as price-to-earnings. Intel Corporation has a P/S of 2.97 and a P/G of .\n\nTechnical\nThe technical numbers for Intel Corporation are as follows: It has a simple moving average 50 of 7.50%, a 52 week high of -5.50%, and a 52 week low of 40.79%. A simple moving average is calculated by adding the closing price of the security for a number of time periods; then divide the total by that number. Intel Corporation has a gap of 0.26%.\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and information expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any company stakeholders, financial professionals, or analysts..

S'\n                    On Oct. 28, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) filed its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving a very thorough overview of its financial results for its fiscal year 2015. In this report, the company includes a number of significant risk factors to its business.\nAlthough the intent of this article isn\'t to suggest that these risks will actually materialize or to disparage Apple (I think that Apple runs a wonderful business), I do believe that it\'s important -- even for those bullish on a company and its shares -- to understand what could go wrong.\nHere are three risks that Apple lists in its annual report that are worth knowing.\nLet\'s talk competition According to Apple, one risk factor is that "global markets for the company\'s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets."\nApple says that its "ability to compete successfully" is dependent on "its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace."\nIn order to make sure it stay competitive, Apple notes that it needs to "make significant investments in research and development."\nFortunately for investors, it would seem that the company is making the necessary big bets here in order to try to maintain its dominance in the high end of the mobile device market, as you can see below:\n\nData source: YCharts.\nApple\'s dependence on others for product distribution Apple states in its annual report that it relies on network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added resellers to get its products to customers. Additionally, as most investors are probably aware, the company also sells products directly to end users via its website as well as through Apple-owned retail stores.\nWireless carriers, Apple points out, that provide network service for its iPhone "typically subsidize users\' purchases of the device." According to Apple,a risk that arises from this is that "there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of [Apple\'s] agreements with these carriers or in agreements [Apple] enters into with new carriers."\nAlso noted in its annual report is that some of its resellers view Apple\'s continued investments in its own online and retail stores as "conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of [Apple\'s] products."\nThis, Apple says, might discourage these resellers "from investing resources in the distribution and sale" of Apple products or might even lead them to "limit or cease distribution" of Apple products altogether.\nThat being said, Apple says that it has historically invested, and will continue to invest, in "programs to enhance reseller sales." The company warns, though, that such programs "could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue."\nSole sourcing is risky Apple states that it "currently obtains components from single or limited sources." This, the company says, means that it\'s "subject to significantly supply and pricing risks."\nTo try to mitigate those risks, it "has entered into agreements for the supply of many components."\nUnfortunately, even this isn\'t enough to completely eliminate the risk of potential supply issues as Apple points out that "there can be no assurance that [it] will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all."\nAdditionally, per Apple, a number of its suppliers "may suffer from poor financial conditions." This, it warns, means that those suppliers could either go out of business or get snapped up by competitors. It feels that these scenarios could make it even harder for it to get enough components to satisfy demand for its products.\nApple also says that its products use some "custom components" that "are not common" to the rest of the mobile device, media device, and personal computer industries. It cautions that in the case when such a component or product employs novel technologies, "initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\' yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased."\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone utilities, stockbrokers, record companies, bookstores, travel agencies, and big box retailers did when the Internet swept away their business models. And when cable falters, you don\'t want to miss out on these 3 companies that are positioned to benefit. Click herefor their names. Hint: They\'re not the ones you\'d think!\n                    \n                '

S'\n                    \nApple\'s newest iPhone 6s and its first-to-market 3D Touch feature point to an innovative company, regardless of relatively small R&D spend. Image source: Flickr user Karlis Dambrans.\nFor technology companies, the ability to create new or improved products and services is paramount. In an industry rife with disruption, only companies that innovate are able to continue to reward investors over the long term. However, this disruption certainly doesn\'t come cheap. For most Silicon Valley firms, their research and development operating expenses comprise a large percentage of its revenue.\nFor investors, however, research and development expense is somewhat of a double-edged sword. As previously stated, investors need technology companies to innovate, but on the other, these are tangible costs that will no longer tumble down the income statement as earnings.\nIn a perfect world, a company would be able to innovate on the cheap -- that is, to spend a low portion of its total revenue on research and development and still bring high-quality innovations to market. It seems tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is doing just that. So while Apple is spending less money, it\'s doing so in a more prudent manner.\nApple\'s spending less Compared with other large tech-related companies (viaBloomberg), Apple spends a much smaller percentage of its top line on research and development. In its last full fiscal year, Apple spent a total of $8.1 billion on the line item, or approximately 3.5% of its revenue during the period. For a comparison to other companies, see this table:\n\n\nCompanyRevenue (FY)R&D (FY)R&D as % of Revenue\n\n\n\nApple\n$233\n$8.1\n3.5%\n\n\nAlphabet\n$66\n$9.2\n15%\n\n\nQualcomm\n$25.3\n$5.6\n22%\n\n\nFacebook\n$12.5\n$2.6\n21%\n\n\n\nSource: Bloomberg Business. Dollar figures in billions.\nApple\'s research and development spend as a percentage of revenue is much larger than all others. This is partially due to the large discrepancy between its massive top line and other companies, as its $8.1 billion research and development spend is larger on a raw-figure basis than all but Alphabet, but also due to a disciplined spend approach that goes back to founder Steve Jobs\' vision and statement that "innovation has nothing to do with how many dollars you have."\nBut is Apple being innovative enough? Of course, it\'s hard to accurately gauge the effectiveness of research and development spend in the short run for a variety of reasons. First, in many cases, research merely becomes an improvement to an existing product, making it difficult to assess its individual effects from a profit standpoint.\nIn addition, the gestation period of innovation to income-statement contribution can be shockingly long. An example is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which invests a portion of its research and development spend into what it affectionately calls "moonshots," high-risk, high-return projects such as its Wing drone delivery project or its Loon project of high-altitude Internet-delivering balloons. Could these be huge revenue drivers in the future? Who knows, but right now these projects only show up as expenses on the income statement.\nThe question, of course, is whether Apple is being prudent in its relatively small research and development outlay. For the reasons I\'ve mentioned, it\'s hard to truly answer this question, but the signs point to yes. The company continues to perfect its signature iPhone, adding 3D Touch to its newest model, and has brought its first post-Jobs device -- the Apple Watch -- to market.\nThese are signs the company is doing fine from an innovation standpoint -- not to mention Bloomberg\'s data is incomplete.\nInnovation is innovation -- whether purchased or created in-house While Bloomberg\'s data is correct -- it\'s technically correct that Apple spends a low figure on in-house research and development -- that\'s not the only way the company acquires innovation. Company acquisitions are also a way for an acquirer to get its hands on game-changing innovations. And since this doesn\'t show up as an R&D expense, it renders Bloomberg\'s analysis incomplete.\nIn fiscal 2015, Apple recorded nearly $350 million after a massive $3.8 billionoutlay last fiscal year, which included its high-profile purchase of Beats Audio. In this calendar year alone, Apple\'s purchased at least 10 companies with technology to improve Siri, Apple Maps, device cameras, and iCloud. The key point for investors is that Apple appears to be able to either create or acquire the technology it needs to compete.The next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

S"\n                    \nImage source: Apple.\nYou're probably familiar with the argument that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) tablet business isn't going so hot right now. Unit sales have been steadily declining for a couple of years, leading to some pessimism and negative press. But the issue right now isn't specific to Apple; it's a categorical decline that we're seeing. The broader tablet market is contracting, and the primary reason is that consumers haven't yet voted with their wallets what an average upgrade cycle will be.\nInvestors now have more evidence that the tablet upgrade cycle is a little longer than you think.\nSurvey saysEarlier this month, right before the iPad Pro launched, Localytics released some estimates on the composition of the current iPad installed base. Localytics is a life-cycle engagement platform and looked at over 50 million iPads to derive its figures. According to Localytics, the iPad 2 remains the most popular iPad model out in the wild, representing 20% of all iPad models as of October 2015.\n\nSource: Localytics.\nThe figures echo the company's estimates from October 2014 when the iPad 2 had a 27% share of all iPads. Localytics notes that Apple's most recent models (iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3, and iPad mini 4) have a combined share of just 12%. The iPad 2's continued strength may come as a surprise since the device was originally released way back in 2011. Despite its age, the iPad 2 had a good long run. It wasn't discontinued until 2014.\nWhat this tells us about the tablet marketThe iPad 2's prevalence tells investors two main things about the tablet market. The first is that many of the tablet adopters between 2011 and 2014 opted for a more affordable tablet. While the iPad 2 was the flagship $500 model for the first year, it cascaded to lower price points over time, as Apple likes to do. This suggests consumers are still somewhat tenuous about buying a pricier flagship, even if that extra $100 buys features like a high-resolution Retina display.\nThe second, and perhaps more obvious, observation is that those consumers who bought iPad 2 models aren't upgrading them. At least not yet. This makes sense because as a product category, smartphones and laptops will always take priority when it comes to upgrading.\nInterestingly, it's not as if the annual performance gains are mitigating like the PC has been seeing for years. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) hasn't been all that focused on boosting CPU performance recently; it's been focusing on improving integrated graphics performance and power efficiency. Typically, the rate of upgrades is somewhat commensurate with the performance gains since there's much more reason to upgrade for a 40% jump in performance (such as the A7 to A8X) than a 5% increase (such as Haswell to Broadwell). But Apple's chip performance has been skyrocketing.\n\nImage source: Apple.\nYet the iPad upgrade cycle doesn't appear to be driven by performance increases. This also implies that use cases don't demand greater performance. Maybe things like reading books, browsing the Web, or sending emails are dominant tablet activities for the average consumer. Upgrade cycles are also related to usage levels, since obviously no one upgrades a device that they don't use. But Tim Cook has long maintained that iPad owners are very engaged and use their iPads regularly.\nIt's not if, but whenThe encouraging thing here for Apple investors is that it's incredibly unlikely that iPad owners will never upgrade their tablets again. It's just taking a little bit longer than expected. But when those users are due for an upgrade, we know through history that they're almost assured to buy another iPad as opposed to switching to another platform.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.\n                    \n                "

(AAPL) isnt exactly known for conformity. In fact, the Cupertino, California-based company is famous (or infamous, depending on your perspective) for marching to the beat of its own drum.\nBut if you want to listen to that proverbial drumbeat on next yearsiPhone 7, you may need a pair of wireless headphones, which Apple will gleefully upcharge you for.\nThats right folks, AAPL may be doing away with the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack altogether  a ubiquitous feature of modern mobile technology. And I hate to say it, but it makes a lot of sense.\nHeres the rationale behind the move, which would be equal parts evil, brilliant and absolutely infuriating.\nTrimmingthe Fat\nBefore getting into the logic behind the change, I should be clear: This is only a rumored change to the iPhone 7. AAPL plays information on its future products close to the chest, and confirming amajor change like this to its flagship product almost a year before its release would be very un-Apple-like.\n5 Big Pharma Stocks to Buy (And 2 Busts to Avoid!)\nThe rumors stem from the Japanese Apple blog MacOtakara, which cites a reliable source as saying the iPhone 7 will literally be too thin to incorporate the 3.5 mm headphone jack. In turn, AAPL will force its sonically inclined customers to use Bluetooth headphones or headphones that plug into Apples proprietary Lightning port.\nThis doesnt imply that AAPL would make theiPhone 7thinner than 3.5mm  the iPhone 6S is 7.1mm, so thatd be quite a jump  but that headphone jack still limits things if youre constantly seeking out the slimmer, sexier phone design.\nWhile these are merely rumors right now, Id be shocked if Apple didnt do this. After all, they can generate extra accessories revenue from adapter sales for those who dont own bluetooth headphones or dont want to shell out that kind of dough. Its not hard to imagine AAPL charging $29.99 for a Lightning port-to-headphone jack adapter.\nMore importantly though, Apple owns Beats, the streaming audio and headphones company AAPL bought for $3 billion last year. Conveniently, Beats already makes wireless, bluetooth-enabled headphones that run anywhere from $199 to $379 a pop. Talk about synergies.\nIts also important to Appleand its top brass that it continue to be viewed as an innovator, however shallow that may sound. Apples vigilant march toward design simplicity means that eradicating wires wherever possible is not only a logical next step, butactually not that revolutionary as far as Apple is concerned.\nFrom Apples notorious refusal to support Adobe (ADBE) Flash, to the abandonment of the standard USB port in the newest MacBook, all the way back to the controversial decision to ship the iMac without a floppy disk drive back in 1998, AAPL has been stubbornly forcing design in its own direction for decades.\nOf course, Apple runs the risk of alienating customers who dont feel like buying pricey Bluetooth headphones or an adapter, but the company is actually making a larger bet that could pay off big.\nLast year, it released specs to manufacturers on how to make headphones that connect to the Lightning port  so being a first mover in sending the headphone jack the way of the dodo may indeed be the endgame.\nAs an Apple shareholder, Im excited. As a consumer, Im less than enthused.\nAs of this writing, John Divine was long AAPL stock.

S'\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Well-respected Seeking Alpha contributor Paulo Santos recently put forth the argument that by no later than the second quarter of its fiscal year 2016, Apple  will start seeing year-over-year declines in iPhone unit sales.\nHe gives a number of risks Apple faces that he believes could drive this, but one, in particular, stood out to me: the "virtual reality risk."(You can read the full articlehere.)\nSantos notes that the iPhone 6s features a display resolution of just 1334 x 750 -- low compared to displays found on other mobile flagships -- which will prove a disadvantage as the "virtual reality boom" happens.\nIndeed, Santos rightly argues that in order for a smartphone to function well as a virtual reality display as part of a virtual reality headset (such as the Samsung  Gear VR), it needs to feature a very high resolution in order to display a clear image in which individual pixels cannot be discerned.\nAlthough I can see where Santos is coming from, I believe the "virtual reality risk" that Apple supposedly faces is more or less immaterial. Here\'s why.\nCan a smartphone really deliver enough performance for a good VR experience? Perhaps the most well-known upcoming VR headset is the Oculus Rift. The device features two displays (one in each eye) running at a display resolution of 1080 x 1200 per eye, and each display is refreshed at a rate of 90 times per second.\nIn order to drive that many pixels and to be able to render content at 90 frames per second requires some very serious computing/graphics horsepower. Just how much, exactly?\nWell, Oculus tells users that the minimum computing requirements for gaming on the Oculus Rift are as follows:\n\n \n GeForce GTX 970/Radeon R9 290 \n Core i5-4590 \n At least 8 gigabytes of memory \n\n\nThis kind of horsepower is well above what one will be able to find in the world\'s best mobile devices, and I don\'t think people should expect to see this kind of power in a phone anytime soon.\nWhat\'s even more interesting, though, is that these are minimum requirements. According to NVIDIA  CEO Jen-Hsun Huang on the company\'s most recent earnings call, his "recommendation" for a VR-capable system would be the company\'s GeForce GTX 980 Ti (a roughly $650 stand-alone graphics card) as the "baseline."\nI submit to the reader that it will be a very long time before smartphones are anything close to the virtual reality devices of choice simply due to the fact that they are, and will likely be for a long while yet, underpowered.\nEven if some Android phones are "better" for VR, who really cares? There has been a lot of hype around virtual reality, and I do think it could catch on within the high-end PC gaming community, in particular.\nAt the same time, though, I think the suggestion that Apple may be poised to lose market share because the iPhone 6s doesn\'t have a display resolution high enough to deliver a good virtual reality experience isn\'t convincing.\nIndeed, I will make the bold prediction that by the time VR capability is something that actually matters to smartphone buyers (which may be never, quite frankly), Apple will have increased the display resolutions on all of its iPhones significantly, rendering this entire "issue"moot.\nThe article Does Apple Inc.

S'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnalysts are weighing in on the technology giantApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and aerospace giant Boeing Co (NYSE:BA).Heres a quick roundup of todaysbullish brokerage notes on AAPL and BA.\n\nApple Inc.\nCredit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garchaand hisAsia Technology team published a report showing that iPhone supply chain orders in Asia continue to face stagnation. The report shows that Apple has recently lowered its orders from suppliers, and that the company plans to build 70 million to 75 million iPhones in December and 45 million to 50 million iPhones in March, lower than what Wall Street has been expecting.\nHowever, Garchareiterated anOutperform rating on Apple shares,with a price target of $140,which implies an upside of 19% from current levels.\nGarchacommented, The CS Asia Technology Team has confirmed in their most recent November survey that the iPhone supply chain orders will be weaker than originally forecast. In our view, the continued weak supply chain news could weigh on Apple shares for the next few weeks/quarters. We continue to believe that with high retention rates, continued installed base growth, and the optionality of a smaller 4-inch iPhone.\nAccording to TipRanks.com, which measures analysts and bloggers success rate based on how their calls perform, analyst Kulbinder Garcha has a total average return of 7.6% and a 55% success rate. Garcha has a 20% average return when recommending AAPL, and is ranked #438 out of 3644 analysts.\n\nOut of the 50 analysts polled by TipRanks, 37 rate Apple stock a Buy, 11 rate the stock a Hold and 2 recommend a Sell. With a return potential of 27%, the stocks consensus target price stands at $148.86.\n\nBoeing Co\nIn a research report issued today, Deutsche Bank analyst Myles Walton maintained a Buy rating on shares ofBoeing,with a price target of $175, which represents a potential upside of 18.5% from where the stock is currently trading.\nWalton wrote, We expect Boeings board to announce the outcome of their annual capital deployment meeting on December 14, 2015. The release dates for the last two years were after the close of markets on December 15, 2014 and December 16, 2013. We expect the company to announce both a material dividend increase (15%) and an increase to their outstanding share repurchase authorization (increase authorization to $12B),\nThe analyst continued, We are modeling a (Street-high) 15% increase in BAs annual dividend following the 25% increase in December 2014 and the 50% increase in December 2013, which would imply a 2016 div yield of 2.7%. We continue to see the dividend as one of the best signals for investors to get confidence in sustainable cash flow growth (implied payout ratio on DBe 2016 EPS would be 44%).\nAccording to TipRanks.com, analyst Myles Walton has a total average return of 8.9% and a 73.5% success rate. Walton has an 18% average return when recommending BA, and is ranked #175 out of 3644 analysts.\nOut of the 18 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 13 rate Boeing stock a Buy, 4 rate the stock a Hold and 1 recommends a Sell. With a return potential of 11%, the stocks consensus target price stands at $164.36.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'

S"\n                           Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU) stock is up by nearly 4% in intra-day trade today. This is the highest intra-day spike seen in its stock price since November 6. The company's shares currently trade around $16.5, after a slump of more than 53% since January. Todays positive price movement follows today's reports about mobile dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chip sales.\nAccording to a Chinese report, demand for DRAM chips has improved lately from the Chinese smartphone manufacturers. Shares of Inotera Memories Inc, a Taiwanese DRAM supplier, immediately surged by 4.1% today on the local stock exchange, after this report surfaced. Micron owns a significant stake in Inotera, which also provides access to all its production output to Micron as part of a joint development agreement with Nanya Technology Corporation.\nAs such, Micron stock has generally followed Inotera throughout the last six years. Even today, Micron shares have followed the movement in the stock price of Inotera. The two companies took major hits during the past year, as PC DRAM and NAND prices continued to decline by 2% and 3.5% on a monthly basis, respectively. Both stocks have plummeted by more than 50% year to date (YTD). However, the report states that a lot of foreign investors in the DRAM industry have turned more optimistic about the second half of the year, mainly because capital expenditure and wafer capacity has slowed, while growth has recovered slightly.\nThe Chinese phone market has also slowed down in the past year, after the economic crisis. With smartphone market recovery in sight, the DRAM demand decline could also reverse. The inventory buildup will likely cover any sudden upsurge in demand, to allow for pricing levels to rebound. Domestic DRAM suppliers such as Nanya, Winbond, and Inotera are expected to get rid of the downturn next year, on a quarterly basis.                        "

S"\n                    With shares of memory chip manufacturer Micron (NASDAQ:MU) trading for around $15 per share, down 50% so far this year, investors may be tempted to buy the stock. During fiscal 2015, which ended in the beginning of September, Micron earned $2.47 per share in net profits, putting the trailing price-to-earnings ratio at a meager value of 6.\n\nMU data by YCharts.\nUnfortunately, things aren't as simple as they seem. Micron's profits, which have reached record levels over the past two years, are in the process of collapsing. During the fourth quarter, Micron's net income fell by nearly 60% year over year, and the company's guidance for the first quarter calls for its non-GAAP EPS to slump by between 73% and 79% year over year. While some analysts believe Micron's profits are close to bottoming out, I'm not so sure.\nFalling DRAM prices Micron manufactures both DRAM and NAND memory chips, and because both are essentially commodities, prices are determined by supply and demand. When demand outpaces supply, like it did in 2014 and the first half of 2015, Micron can record incredible profits. But when supply outpaces demand, like it did in 2012, Micron does very badly, often posting massive losses.\n\nDXI index. Source: DRAMeXchange.\n\nDRAM, which accounts for about two-thirds of Micron's revenue, has been falling in price during the second half of 2015. DRAMeXchange tracks an index that represents the output value of mainstream DRAM chips, and this index fell sharply from June to August of this year-- and after a brief respite, the index is falling sharply again.\nSpot prices of specific DRAM variants have declined dramatically since the beginning of June. Here's how a few of them have evolved:\n\nData from DRAMeXchange.\nOf course, the big question is where DRAM prices will go in the future. If Micron can cut its cost-per-bit of DRAM faster than the selling price declines, the company's profits may very well bottom out in the next couple of quarters. But if DRAM prices keep falling sharply, all bets are off.\nGartner expects the oversupply situation in the DRAM market to get much worse in 2016:\n\nWhile 2015 has already seen an oversupply in the PC segment of the DRAM market, we believe that 2016 will see a more widespread oversupply that will also impact the server and low-power sectors of the DRAM market. DRAM revenue is forecast to decline 12.2 percent in 2016 due to oversupply and resulting weak pricing.\n\nWhile weak PC demand has hurt the market for PC DRAM this year, demand for smartphone DRAM has remained strong. During the fourth quarter, while profitability in Micron's Compute Networking Business Unit, which contains PC and server DRAM, collapsed compared to the third quarter, profitability in the Mobile Business Unit mostly held up, with revenue growing slightly.\nBut the smartphone market is not growing anywhere near as fast as it once was. Gartner reported that worldwide smartphone unit sales rose by 13.5% year over year during the second quarter, the slowest rate in years, driven by a 4% decline in China. With DRAM manufacturers actively shifting capacity to mobile, the risk of overestimating mobile demand is very real.\nNew competition One thing Micron has going for it is industry consolidation. There are only three major DRAM manufacturers remaining, the other two being Samsung and SK Hynix, and the bull argument for Micron hinges on fewer competitors leading to less violent swings in DRAM prices. The hope is that Micron's profitability will bottom out above break-even, which would be a drastic shift from the past.\nUnfortunately for Micron, new competition appears to be on the horizon. In July, it was reported that state-owned Chinese tech company Tsinghua Unigroup was preparing a $23 billion bid to acquire Micron. Regulatory issues make the deal unlikely, with Micron itself stating that the deal is not possible due to national security concerns.\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Tsinghua has changed course, with plans to invest more than $12 billion in an effort to build a memory chip business in China. Most of the cash, which will be raised in a private placement, will be used to build a memory chip factory, with the rest going toward acquisitions of semiconductor companies.\nWhile it will likely take at least a few years, and possibly longer, before the company produces any memory chips, the prospect of raising the number of major DRAM manufacturers back to four kills one of the arguments for investing in Micron.\nWhile Micron stock looks cheap, the company is facing some pretty serious headwinds. If weakness in the DRAM market broadens in 2016, as Gartner is predicting, Micron's profitably is unlikely to bottom out anytime soon, and when it does, it's very possible the company will be in the red, depending on how far prices fall. Looking out further, the potential addition of a major Chinese competitor could essentially undo the consolidation in the DRAM industry. The bottom line: Micron is a risky investment despite its seemingly attractive valuation.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early, in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.\n                    \n                "

And with strong support behind shares, Nvidia stock appears to have even more opportunity ahead.\nEarnings back on Nov. 5 were a crowd-pleaser for NVDA bulls, and rightfully so. The multi-faceted graphics chip platform designer blew past Street top- and bottom-line views, and upped guidance with results supported by strong results from its GTX gaming platform, high-performance computing, cloud and automotive platforms.\nInvestors acknowledged the report with an enthusiastic jump of nearly 14% the following session, while broker MKM Partners upped NVDA shares to a buy, stating Nvidia was expensive but worth it.\nA few weeks later, the price of NVDA stock appears worth it even more.\nNvidia Stock Weekly Chart\n\nClick to Enlarge The weekly view of NVDA gives a solid view of its strength and relative outperformance this quarter. Whats more, Nvidia stock gave astute technicians a heads up or two of a pending bullish shift toward a position of technical leadership.\n3 Covered Calls for a Rich, Happy New Year\nBack in late August during the markets mini-flash crash, NVDA stock moved lower but failed to hit fresh lows for 2015 and/or display even more severe weakness such as a test of its October 2014 low. That of course, can be appreciated as a good first sign of pending strength.\nAdditionally, as the market and many stocks rallied initially off the August low, most went on to establish fairly deep pullbacks by the tail-end of September. NVDA did not and in fact was rallying to fresh highs for 2015.\nIf traders missed NVDAs first and more subtle sign of strength, the second was certain confirmation of NVDA stock fast becoming a favorite of bullish investors and one to put on the radar for continued technical leadership as the market regained its own footing.\nNow with shares of NVDA having added to its initial promise of higher prices, a fresh bullish pattern has developed. A breakout of a tight and flat three-week consolidation is signaling another leg higher for Nvidia stock.\nNvidia Bull Call Vertical Strategy\n\nClick to Enlarge A check of the NVDAs volatility levels shows premiums to buy a long call for bullish positioning are about as affordable and well-priced for such an opportunity as they have been in all of 2015, but a vertical spread which cuts down still relevant time decay and volatility risks, is viewed as a stronger alternative.\nReviewing the NVDA stock options board and shares trading up by about 2% at $32.35 in early trade on Tuesday, the Jan $33/$35 bull call spread for up to 65 cents is viewed favorably.\nThe spread breakeven of $33.65 compares to an outright January $33 call breakeven of $34.05 and reduction of 38% in the overall premium paid per contract.\nAs a trader always looking to minimize risk and maximize profits, the more favorable pricing is an extension of reducing time decay and volatility risks and an attractive feature of a vertical spread.\nOn the downside, a vertical like this wont show nearly as robust, quick gains as might be possible with an outright long call position. But with the opportunity to realize a return in excess of 205% in several weeks time; this vertical is inexpensive and worth it as an effective way to position strategically in Nvidia stock.\nInvestment accounts under Christopher Tylers management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

The P/E of a company is commonly used when comparing current earnings to forecasted future earnings. For example, if a company forecasts future profitability, the estimated P/E will be lower than the current P/E. P/E is calculated by dividing the market price per share by the expected earnings per share, and also referred to as price-to-earnings. NVIDIA Corporation has a P/S of 3.51 and a P/G of .\n\nTechnical\nThe technical numbers for NVIDIA Corporation are as follows: It has a simple moving average 50 of 15.03%, a 52 week high of -0.31%, and a 52 week low of 70.25%.

S'\n                    Many people often forget that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), through its acquisition of Nokia\'s handset business, is now one of the largest feature phone makers in the world. Over the past year, Microsoft has focused on launching cheap feature phones like the refreshed Nokia 105, which costs just $20. \nHowever, Microsoft recently shifted from that strategy by launching the Nokia 230, its priciest feature phone to date, for $55. That\'s just $15 less than its cheapest Lumia and pricier than Android devices like the SWIPE Konnect 3 and Kenxinda K528, which both cost less than $30. So, what does Microsoft hope to gain by launching a high-end feature phone that costs more than low-end smartphones?\n\nThe Nokia 230. Source: Microsoft.\n"Dumbphones" aren\'t dead yetFeature phones are still used across large parts of the world because they have lower price tags, require lower monthly data fees, and can last for weeks on a single charge. Smartphones only started outselling feature phones worldwide in 2013. According to research firm eMarketer, only about a fifth of mobile users in India used smartphones last year, compared to two-thirds inAmerica. Pew Research Center estimates that across seven sub-Saharan African nations, 65% of people still use feature phones.\nMicrosoft highly values these markets, because Apple and Alphabet\'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, the two biggest players in smartphones, can\'t control the feature phone market. IDC claims that Microsoft actually generated more revenue from Nokia\'s feature phones ($765 million) than from Lumia devices ($754 million) in the third quarter of 2015.\nThrough the Nokia brand, Microsoft can launch scaled down versions of its apps, like Bing Search and MSN Weather, to tether more users in these markets to its ecosystem. Microsoft hopes that when these feature phone users upgrade to smartphones, they\'ll consider buying Windows 10 Mobile devices instead of iOS or Android ones, which would tether them to its "One Windows" ecosystem. That could help Microsoft boost its tiny 2.6% share of the global smartphone market.\nMicrosoft\'s tiered pricing strategyMicrosoft\'s feature phones cost between $20 to $55. The Lumia 430, Microsoft\'s cheapest smartphone, costs $70. However, the $55 Nokia 230 packs a decent punch for a feature phone. It comes with front and rear cameras, and each is supported with an LED flash. The 2-megapixel rear camera is comparable to Lumia 430\'s camera.\n\nThe Lumia 430. Source: Microsoft.\nThe Internet-enabled phone can download scaled-down apps like Bing Search, MSN Weather, and Opera Mini, and it supports microSD cards up to 32GB. Microsoft also replaced the colorful plastic cases of previous Nokia feature phones with black and white cases with a gray, sand-blasted aluminum back cover for both colors. The device will launch in India, Asia, and the Middle East in December, and go on sale in other markets in 2016.\nThe $30 to $50 "sweet spot"The Nokia 230 isn\'t cannibalizing Microsoft\'s own smartphones, but cheaper Android devices could steal customers away from both the Nokia 230 and the Lumia 430.\nGoogle has been expanding into key markets like India with its "Android One" initiative, which attempts to reduce hardware and software fragmentation by getting OEMs to stick with similar specs and stock Android. However, Google encountered resistance in India because its original price target of $100 was considered too high. That\'s whyit relaunched several Android One phones with its partners this summer to target a "sweet spot" between $30 and $50. \nGoogle\'s plan to drive down smartphone prices to the same price as feature phones could disrupt Microsoft\'s tiered pricing strategy and squeeze out pricier feature phones like the Nokia 230. If that happens, Microsoft must launch even cheaper feature phones and low-end Lumias to compete against Google, which offers users access to a bigger mobile ecosystem of apps and services.\nMicrosoft\'s murky mobile futureMicrosoft\'s mobile strategy of using Nokia-branded feature phones to capture first-time smartphone buyers sounds smart. But in reality, cheap smartphones are replacing feature phones too quickly for Microsoft\'s plan to pay off. Microsoft will also lose the right to use Nokia\'s brand for mobile phones at the end of 2016, which means that its current strategy isn\'t a sustainable long-term one.\nFalling smartphone prices and data fees will likely render feature phones obsolete in the near future. As a result, Microsoft could be at a disadvantage again when customers in developing and emerging markets buy low-end Android devices instead of Windows 10 Mobile ones.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.'

S'    \n        Microsoft has laid off 60 people in Israel working on the HoloLens project. A spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday that 30 contractors and 30 full-time staff will no longer be working on the virtual reality system.\n"We continually evaluate our business needs and recently made decisions affecting some positions in one of our groups in Israel," a Microsoft spokesperson told International Business Times."As needed, we increase investments in some areas and de-invest in others which results in the movement of jobs across the organization, and at times, job eliminations. Our priority is to work with and support employees affected by this decision."\nThe layoffs were first reported by TechCrunch.\nHowever, Microsoft is continuing to build out its HoloLens team in Seattle. The company has posted a job listing for a creative director on LinkedIn, who would be at the forefront of delivering "consumer products" and "new experiences" with the HoloLens team.The listing provides a glimpse into the plans Microsoft may have for the HoloLens\' future direction, which the company hinted at during its October presentation.\nThe team in Israel focused around a $35 million acquisition of a startup back in 2009 that focused on motion sensing and capturing. Although initially speculated as relating to the Kinect project, Microsoft publicly disputed this idea, and it later emerged that the acquisition was related to HoloLens instead.\nThe HoloLens development kit is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2016 and represents an important element of the company\'s overall Windows 10 strategy. The system will run Windows 10, building on new holographic APIs that allow developers to get their Windows 10 apps running in the augmented reality world Microsoft is developing. HoloLens demonstrates the versatility of Windows 10, and pushes the platform in an innovative new direction.\nAlthough initial demonstrations focused on the HoloLens\' use in industry, Microsoft took to the stage at its Surface Book event and showed the headset\'s gameplay capabilities. "Project X-Ray" demonstrated a man fighting virtual robots that infiltrated his living room, utilizing the system\'s augmented reality features to bring the enemies to life.\n      \n      \n  '

The latest challenge that Microsoft launched takes the form of its digital assistant, Cortana. Cortana is setting the innovation pace for other PAs such as Siri from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Now from Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG) It is faster, more personal, and it can make contextual references. Microsoft has now launched the beta testing of Cortana for iOS.\n\nWhile you are trying to test out Cortana on your iPhone and iPad, it might interest you to know that Microsoft has also raised the bar on tech innovation with headsets that help the blind to see. The smart headsets are the first of its kind in helping the visually impaired find their way about the world around them. Microsofts foray into the smart headset space serves two important functions for the firm.\nCortana for iOS + Smart Headsets + Skype for Business = Innovation\nWhen Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) unveiled Cortana on Windows 10, it was obvious that she was the best in-class digital assistant around. The firm surprised the world when it revealed that it would make Cortana cross-platform for Android and iOS. The Android Version has been out for about three months. Now Cortana is ready to displace Siri.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

She can also track flights, packages, stocks, scores, and more, the goal being for all of this to work in unison so that you get contextual information based on where you are and what the app thinks youre doing there.\nMicrosoft also revealed an upgrade to one of its old-time products today as it unveiled Skype for business. Skype for business is packaged with Office 365 and it allows firms to hold virtual meetings with as much as 10,000 people on practically all devices.

S'\n    Microsoft shares rallied on Monday after a key upgrade from analysts at Raymond James. The stock continued to climb during morning trading today, rising by as much as 0.92% to $54.85 per share as the firms analysts explained that their bullish stance on the software giant is based on its opportunities in cloud services.\nRaymond James upgrade follows another upgrade from Piper Jaffray earlier this month based on the success of Microsofts Xbox division and exclusive games.\n\nMicrosoft upgraded to Strong Buy\nIn a report dated Nov. 30, Raymond James analyst Michael Turits, Ph.D., set a price target of $62 per share for Microsoft with his upgrade to Strong Buy. He noted that just recently, it looked like Microsoft had missed the mobile movement, but now he sees solid opportunities in the next direction technology is moving in, which is the cloud. He thinks the company is one of the only hyperscale hybrid cloud vendors able to integrate Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, and Software-as-a-Service through its onsite servers and software.\nHe said the company is several years into the cloud transition, noting that it is expected to make up about 17% of its total revenue in fiscal 2016. As a result, hes predicting a 6% compound annual growth rate between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2018 in total revenue.\nPraise for Microsofts Azure\nThe Raymond James analyst and his team called Azure one of the hyperscale elite, echoing similar comments made by other firms. Azure is widely seen as a likely path away from the tumbling PC and software market and toward strong growth opportunities. He sees only Amazon Web Services and Google as being among the small group of cloud vendors that might be on the level with Azure and named Oracle for its expertise in Platform-as-a-Service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\n\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  #admobil {\n      display:none;\n }\n  #adpost {\n      display:inline-block;\n      width:290px !important;\n      height:235px;\n }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 600px) {\n  #admobil {\n      display:none;\n }\n  #adpost {\n      display:inline-block;\n      width:336px;\n      height:280px;\n }\n}\n\n\n\nFurther, he praised Microsoft CEO Satya Nadellas aggressively open strategy toward offering the companys products on other platforms and believes this move will make Azure dominant in both Platform-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service.\nMicrosoft benefits from Office 365\nTurits also sees opportunities in Microsofts subscription-based Office 365 and noted that the companys suite of productivity software has remained steady despite Googles free offerings in this area. In fact, he said Office 365 seems to be accelerating several years into the transition to cloud and that he likes the pricing and value of the cross-platform strategy, which he believes will maintain loyalty to Microsofts productivity software. He sees continued growth in the commercial value of Office as well.\nAnd finally, on the topic of the risk to Windows and PCs, he thinks that as Microsofts cloud offerings become more valuable, they will more than offset the declines from the weakness in PCs, which has resulted in weakness in Windows monetization. He notes that Windows consumer business is expected to make up only 4% of total revenue in fiscal 2016, while the commercial side is expected to contribute 12% of total revenue the same year. He added that while Windows revenue is expected to decline 5%, non-Windows revenue, which includes the Surface tablets, Bing, and the Xbox, is expected to increase 6%.\nHe did trim his non-GAAP revenue estimate from $93.3 billion to $91.8 billion and his non-GAAP earnings from $2.74 to $2.62 per share for fiscal 2016, however, to account for currency headwinds and cloud ipacts.\nLike this article?

S'\n                           The European Patent Office (EPO) is now giving out legal threats, in response to recent allegations made against it, regarding maintaining a special cooperative relationship with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The agency denies such accusations and says that it will not accept its staff being subject to such accusations. EPO is shifting to a more offensive strategy from the defensive one that it previously practiced.\nIn October, Roy Schestowitz, along with his site Techrights, was the first to claim Microsoft was getting preference in its patent applications by the EPO. He published a leaked EPO internal email from February 16 that lists Microsofts submitted patent documents, and asks examiners to give the applications top priority as soon as possible. The emails author and a senior member at the agency, Grant Philpott, mentioned of a close cooperation project with the software giant in the message.\nRegarding the cooperation project and priority mentioned in the email for Microsoft, the EPO defends itself and claims that it did nothing wrong.\nAn EPO spokesman, Jeremy Philpott  no relation, talked about a pilot program termed as the cooperation project between the agency and large companies like Microsoft, Qualcomm, Philips, Canon, Bayer, BASF, Samsung, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Siemens, and Huawei. This was meant to treat the high number of patent applications from these companies as efficiently as possible.\nThe pilot was created, as the agency claims, to find a solution to work on Microsofts backlog of 450 patent applications. EPO feared that the company may attempt to break this log-lock by requesting all 450 be dealt through the special and quick PACE review process, which could result in too much time and resources being poured on Microsofts applications immediately. To avoid this, it made a deal with Microsoft to start work immediately on the backlogged patents, provided that the company chooses a small sub-group from the 450 applications.\nThe internal email by Grant Philpott did refer to the EPOs PACE program for a list of 14 patent applications that had to be given priority. The PACE program is a fast track patent application process available for no extra cost to any patent of any size. EPOs explanation does seem solid and void of loopholes. However, there was no public announcement of this cooperation project or pilot program until the memo was leaked and published by Mr. Schestowitz. Furthermore, the PACE program has been adopted since 2010, which raises the question as to why Microsoft would be opting for this process discreetly as part of a cooperation program that no one else heard about?\nNow that the agency has defended its position in the matter, it is aiming to go after the people who started allegations of this nature. Since the issue was sparked by Mr. Schestowitz, other blog posts made numerous accusations about the EPO tossing out patent applications submitted by small European businesses. The patent authority said that these allegations were not only false but detrimental to its reputation as a public servant. They insisted and demanded the post to be pulled down, with which Mr. Schestowitz unwillingly complied.\nSpeaking to The Register, as this publication shows, the EPO said that while it respects press freedom and often engages in public debates, it will not let its staff face the fire. The agency says that such allegations directly attack its employees course of work and will protect them and their families by any means necessary.\nThe patent authority did not hesitate to issue legal threats to Mr. Schestowitz and his long-time running website. Some bloggers, who closely follow the patent and intellectual property industry, did not hold back to express their opinion of how they felt about the EPOs action and its legal threats to Mr. Schestowitz.

S"\n                           Alphabet Inc.s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) venture capital division, Google Ventures will reduce its focus on seed investment, while it continues to see the health sector as a high growth opportunity, as per the recently released year in review. Google Ventures, which is renamed as GV this week, is one of the most prominent investors and has pushed more than 300 start-ups, including Nest that was acquired by Google for $3.2 billion, and giants such as Uber. However, competition for investments has driven up private tech companies valuation in recent times, and GV has found it difficult to find decent deals.\nLess Emphasis on Seed Funding\nThis year, GV completed very few investment deals in the $100,000-300,000 range. As a strategy shift, it will emphasize less on seed funding in 2016 and provide only venture and growth-stage funding to established tech firms. This is because despite the fact seed-stage investments provide higher return opportunities, they involve greater risk. It also becomes more complex for the multi-stage investment company to manage different start-ups at different business stages.\nHowever, the major reason for this shift is to facilitate mature companies that resist listing, to go public. The number of IPOs made by health and tech-sector industries has fallen 43% this year till November, compared to same period in 2014. Tech firms such as Uber and Airbnb are considered to be ahead of the curve in the technology investment space, and have raised more money with time despite showing no indication of going public. GV holds the belief that if listed, these companies could benefit from the discipline that public market requires.\nWith Google now restructured into multiple divisions with Alphabet as the parent company, the investment wing will be renamed as GV. This purpose is to distinguish the division further from the core Internet business. It will also prevent any possible conflicts of interest and give investors a more clear idea of future operations, while investment seekers will benefit from receiving quality financial advice from a firm backed by one of the biggest corporations on the planet.\nLife Sciences and Health to Continue Dominating Investments\nIn what appeared to be a rugged year, GV's CEO Bill Maris states in a letter that the venture has placed $2.4 billion under investment as opposed to $1.6 billion last year. However, the number of companies supported has fallen from 57 to 39. Mr. Maris believes this was because greater amount of money being put into investments caused prices to hike and negotiating powers moved more toward the entrepreneurs.\n\nEven though Health and Life Sciences attained the highest share of investment in 2015 at 31%, it has dropped from the 36% share reported last year. Mr. Maris has not disclosed the exact figure invested in healthcare and life sciences, but The Wall Street Journal quotes him as having said that GV will place somewhere around $200-250 million in the sector in the next two years. Expected total investment in this sector is likely to hit the $1 billion mark by 2021, as GV believes it is essential to improve human health and the quality life worldwide.\nConsumer sector has seen a massive jump from 8% invested last year to 24% current, but Mr. Maris has played down the significance and suggested that it simply implies the sector had greater opportunities this year. Investments in mobile technologies seem to have suffered the most, as it is not mentioned in the break-up at all this year despite accounting for 27% investment in 2014.\nGoing forward, it is clear that health-based start-ups would have a healthy financial backer available in the form of GV. But it remains to be seen whether the founders of matured tech firms would remain cautious and go public when they feel the time is right, or if they would take GVs advice and benefit from the public market systems.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) currently has a strong lead in the wearable tech segment as its Apple Watch continues to appeal to a wide variety of users. When the Apple Watch first launched, there were fears that the device would end up being a niche product for fitness nuts and die-hard Apple fans. The widespread appeal of the device and the rising use of Apple Watch for different functions helped to cement its lead over other smartwatches. Yet, Android Wear from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is close on the heels of the Apple Watch.\n\nTechradar reports that the latest update on Android Wear is designed to take the stress out of planning your day. Google Now on Android wear (Googles digital assistant for smartwatches) has gotten a facelift with a new update. The new update provides a cleaner, simpler way to access Googles digital assistant as they take the day once glance at a time.\nHeres how Android Wear could take on Apple Watch\nThe wearable tech market is fast growing as smartwatches threaten to disrupt the 450-year old watch-making industry. The market for the modern Smartwatch has been valued at $30B and Apple Watch is the center of attraction as it combines the technology with sharp, clean, and modern design for the wristwatch. The Smartwatch market is home to about 8 different major products but the Apple Watch controls a 58.3% market share.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

To start with, Android Wear has an edge over Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch in that Android Wear allows you to communicate instead of being a hub for notifications. Tech Crunch notes that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android Wear syncs to your phone, all of your alerts and notifications get pushed directly to your wrist  and that wrist vibration can keep you from missing calls in meetings.\nSwiss watchmakers are in love with Android Wear\nThe strongest move that might help Android Wear overtake Apple Watch is its growing romance with Swiss Watchmakers. Last month, Swiss watchmaker, Tag Heuer started the trend for Android Wear when it unveiled a $1500 Smartwatch. The device looks very much like a classic timepiece but it is powered by Android Wear. The device has rave reviews in the market because of Tag Heuer strong design ethic and brand power.\nOn Sunday, it was reported that Tag Heuers Android Smartwatch is having a decent showing in the Smartwatch space and the firm cant seem to make the watches as fast as it sells them. The success of Tag Hueres Smartwatch might encourage other Swiss watchmakers to start making smartwatches for their brands. The Watch OS is locked to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch alone; hence, Swiss watchmakers might have no other option than Android Wear.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

S'\n                    \nCredit: Adobe Systems Incorporated.\n\nAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock fell as much as 3% in Thursday\'s after-hours trading following the release of its fiscal third-quarter 2015 results. But don\'t take that to mean the quarter itself was bad.\nTo the contrary, quarterly revenue grew 22% year over year, to $1.22 billion, and adjusted net income nearly doubled, to $275.4 million, or $0.54 per share. Analysts, on average, were only anticipating earnings of $0.50 per share on revenue of $1.21 billion.\nDigging deeperAdobe\'s top line was driven both by strong adoption of Creative Cloud and record sales from Adobe Marketing Cloud. On the former, Creative Cloud subscriptions increased by 684,000, leaving Adobe with a total of 5.3 million subscriptions at quarter\'s end. Combined with the early success and annual value of enterprise agreements for Adobe Stock -- not the ticker, but rather a new stock content service launched in June -- annualized recurring revenue from digital sources grew sequentially by $262 million, to roughly $2.3 billion. On the latter, Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue reached a company-record $368 million, good for growth of 27% year over year.\nRecurring revenue represented 73% of Adobe\'s total in fiscal Q3, up from around 67% last quarter and 63% in the same year-ago period.For that, Adobe can largely thank a 51.5% year-over-year increase in subscription revenue as it transitions to the cloud, and away from its installed base of perpetual licenses. Meanwhile, that growth came partly at the expense of product-based revenue, which fell just more than 21%. But you\'d be hard-pressed to find Adobe management complaining, as higher cloud-based subscriptions not only result in a more predictable revenue stream, but also come with superior margins.\nAdobe\'s operating expenses climbed less than 1% year over year, notably including a modest 3.8% increase in sales and marketing, to $422 million, a3% increase in R&D expenses, to $218.7 million (or around 18% of revenue), and a 13.5% decline in general and administrative expenses, to $122.6 million.\nAdobe also generated healthy cash flow from operations of $360 million, while deferred revenue climbed to a new company high mark of $1.31 billion. On the bottom line, Adobe bolstered investors\' per-share profits by repurchasing around 1.6 million shares during the quarter for a total of $132 million.\nHere\'s what happenedIf you\'re wondering why the stock is falling right now, look no further than Adobe\'s guidance. Though Adobe CFO Mark Garrett praised the results as setting the company up for a strong end to the fiscal year, he also noted that -- similar to thetrend last year in Creative -- the transition to subscriptions is now happening faster than previously anticipated for Adobe\'s Acrobat, Lightroom, and Photoshop Elements products.\nConsequently, that means slightly lower-than-expected revenue in the fourth quarter, as revenue is recognized during the course of these subscriptions rather than in a single lump sum, as with perpetual licenses. For the reasons described above, investors should be pleased, as this signals accelerated progress in Adobe\'s transition.\nIn the meantime, however, Adobe expects revenue in the current quarter to be $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion, while adjusted earnings per share should be in the range of $0.56 to $0.62. Wall Street, for its part, was modeling fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $1.36 billion, and adjusted earnings of $0.64 per share.\nBut don\'t get too upset by the market\'s misstep: Going into today\'s close, Adobe stock was already up more than 10% year to date. And shareholders can take solace knowing that the after-hours decline essentially brings shares back to last week\'s levels -- hardly a move of any consequence from a long-term investor\'s perspective. Over time, as Adobe\'s move to the cloud becomes less pronounced, so, too, should its increasingly typical post-earnings declines on what the market perceives as "weak" guidance.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.\n                    \n                '

Even so, the 0.8% gain the S&P 500 managed to dish out today was respectable, leaving the index within reach of a break above its ceiling tomorrow.\nThere were more than a few stocks that didnt even come close to dishing out meaningful bullishness on Wednesday, however. Among the most alarming losers were Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), GoPro Inc (NASDAQ:GPRO) and Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE), mostly thanks to analyst actions.\nAdobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE)\nLooks like software giant Adobe Systems isnt going to do quite as well in 2016 as once thought. The company that makes Acrobat and Photoshop now says its apt to earn $2.70 per share in the coming year, on revenue of $5.7 billion. Analysts had been collectively expecting a profit of $3.19 per share of ADBE on sales of $5.93 billion.\nAdobe offered a pair of understandable reasons for the contracted outlook: disadvantageous exchange rates and the migration from installed software to cloud-based software.\n5 Stocks That Could Be 30%-Plus Winners\nNot all analysts were sympathetic to the companys plight, though, lowering expectations from ADBE anyway. Credit Suisse, for instance, dropped its price target on ADBE from $75 to $65, although it maintained its neutral stance.\nADBE fell more than 5% on the news.\nTesla Motors Inc (TSLA)\nThe base model of the much-ballyhooed Model X from Tesla Motors is going to cost more than the market was expecting. With marketability questions suddenly surfacing, traders sent TSLA shares lower by nearly 4%.\nWhats interesting is that news of the cars price wasnt unveiled today  the sticker price of $132,000 for the top-of-the-line model was unveiled a few weeks ago. But, after mulling it in the meantime, analysts for Morgan Stanley finally decided sticker-shock for the electric vehicle could pose a sales problem. Specifically, Morgan Stanley cut its target price on TSLA today, from $465 to $450, based on the vehicles price.\nBaird & Co. analyst Ben Kallo did the same, though for a slightly different reason. He explained:\nWe are confident TSLA will be able to ramp Model X production, although the timing is uncertain, and with the current market backdrop we would like to keep some dry powder. With limited visibility to positive catalysts until the release of the Model III prototype [in early 2016], we are moving to the sidelines.\nKallo moved his price target on TSLA from $335 to $282.\nGoPro Inc (GPRO)\nLast but not least, GoPro shares finished the day down more than 4% on the heels of another Morgan Stanley downgrade.\nMorgan Stanley analyst James Faucette opined:\nCommentary by management at recent investor events confirm that Session [the companys newest camera] has been a difficult sell at the same price point of its historically favorite HERO4 Silver model.  Disappointing demand culminated in GoPro announcing its decision to reduce the price to $299 last week, a $100 discount from the $399 price point when the product was launched in July.\nErgo, Faucette cut his price target on GPRO from $62 to $35, yet still somehow justified holding the official call as equal weight.\nAs of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\nMore From InvestorPlace\nTSLA Stock: Is the Tesla Model Y Coming Next?\n10 Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for the Dividends\nYum Brands Makes a Strong Case Against China\n\n\t\n\n\t\n"

S"\n                    The Internet of Things (IoT) -- which includes connected devices like wearables, smart appliances, and connected cars -- is widely expected to become the next major growth market for the tech industry. Research firm IDC estimates that the global IoT market will grow from $656 billion in 2014 to $1.7 trillion in 2020.\n\nSource: Pixabay.\nThat's why big chipmakers like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) are aggressively expanding into the IoT market. Intel, the largest PC and data-center chipmaker in the world, is using it to diversify away from its sluggish PC and mobile chip businesses. Qualcomm, the world's top mobile chipmaker, is expanding into IoT to diversify away from the saturated smartphone and tablet markets. As a result, the two tech giants are now clashing on multiple fronts across the IoT market. Let's take a closer look at both companies' core IoT strengths to see if either can triumph over the other.\nQualcomm's IoT strengthsQualcomm controls over half of the smartphone application processor market and about 60% of the LTE baseband market, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, and hopes to use those established markets as a launchpad for its IoT efforts.\nLast year, 120 million smart-home devices, 20 million cars, and 20 types of wearable devices were all powered by Qualcomm chips. To expand that reach, Qualcomm acquired CSR, an electronics company that specializes in Bluetooth, wireless, and automotive infotainment services, for $2.5 billion earlier this year. It also established the AllSeen Alliance, an IoT consortium that uses its open source AllJoyn framework as a communications standard for IoT devices. The AllSeen Alliance currently has over160 members. To tether more start-ups to that growing ecosystem, Qualcomm launched the Qualcomm Robotics Accelerator, which provides resources to start-ups specializing in robotics and IoT technologies. \nQualcomm also recently signed a deal with Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX), the largest maker of FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) in the world, to use itsfield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate workloads in its new data-center chips.On their own, FPGA chips are weaker thantraditional CPUs, but they can be reprogrammed for a wide variety of tasks in connected cars, factory automation, and more. Therefore, it's possible that Qualcomm might expand its partnership with Xilinx to reach additional IoT markets.\nQualcomm doesn't break out its IoT revenues on a quarterly basis. However, it claims that it generated $1 billion in revenues last year by selling IoT chips for city infrastructure projects, home appliances, connected cars, and wearables. That $1 billion amounts to less than 4% of Qualcomm's 2014 revenue, but it still represents a promising start. Looking ahead, Qualcomm intends to expand its IoT business with SoCs (system on a chip) for connected cameras and drones. \n\nQualcomm's Snapdragon Cargo. Source: Qualcomm.\nIntel's IoT strengthsIntel's x86 chips still power the vast majority of PCs and servers worldwide, but it lost the mobile market to Qualcomm and other chipmakers that licensed ARM's (NASDAQ:ARMH) low-power chip designs. Intel doesn't plan to lose the IoT market in the same way. That's why it's expanding into the IoT with low-power Atom and Quark processors, and tiny computing modules like Edison and Curie, which can be installed in a wide range of connected devices like wearables, smart appliances, and cars. It's also expanding that business into drones by combining its processors with 3D-sensing RealSense cameras.\nIntel leads a group of companies known as the Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC), which is establishing an open IoT communication standard based on its IoTivity framework. This alliance only has about half as many members as Qualcomm's AllSeen Alliance, but it has considerable strength in China. Intel's pending acquisition of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR), the second-largest maker of FPGAs in the world after Xilinx, will give it in-house access to hardware that should accelerate the performance of its data-center chips and possibly enhance its IoT chips and modules in the future.\n\nIntel's Edison. Source: Intel.\nUnlike Qualcomm, Intel reports IoT revenues on a quarterly basis. Last quarter, its IoT revenues rose 10% annually to $581 million and accounted for 4% of its top line. To broaden the division's reach, Intel recently created a new client and IoT business and systems architecture group that combines the platform engineering, client computing, IoT, software and services, and design and technology groups. It also hired Venkata Renduchintala, the former co-president of Qualcomm's main chip unit, to lead the new group.\nThe verdict: Too close to callQualcomm and Intel are both making solid progress in the IoT market, and it's impossible to predict which chipmaker will create the bigger ecosystem until the market matures. For now, investors should expect the two chipmakers to keep clashing with competing communication standards and chip designs in fledgling markets like connected cars, drones, and smart homes. But as long as both companies stay invested in the IoT market, sales of IoT chips should gradually start accounting for bigger chunks of their top-line growth.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Stocks logged their biggest single-session gains in three months on Friday after November non-farm payrolls came in stronger than expected. \nLooking to add to Fridays across-the-board gains, U.S. stock futures on the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average were last seen up, on average, 0.25% heading into the open.\nOptions volume was strong on Friday, with December expiration driving heavy activity across the board. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio fell to a reading of 0.61, pulling the 10-day moving average lower to 0.68.\nLooking at equity options activity, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was flooded with calls on Friday due to weekly December 4 series expiration and news that Samsung would finally start paying more than $548 million in penalties for patent infringement. Meanwhile, Kinder Morgan Inc. (NYSE:KMI) options traders appear to be searching for a bottom to the beleaguered stock, as call volume finally outpaced put volume in Fridays session. Finally, Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) was also call heavy after the company announced it was testing live video streaming options in the U.S.\nVisa Keeps the Uptrend Going\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\nIt looks like Samsung is finally going to pay up after losing a 2012 iPhone patent infringement lawsuit. According to papers filed on Thursday, Samsung has agreed to pay roughly $548 million in penalties related to the infringement of Apple patents used in the iPhone. That said, Samsung is still appealing the decision, which could reverse those penalties.\nDriven in part by December expiration, AAPL option volume swelled to a near-term high 846,866 contracts on Friday. Calls were the investment vehicle of choice for AAPL traders, with these typically bullish bets accounting for 64% of the days take. \nTurning our attention to weekly December 11 series open interest, we find that call traders still have their sights set on the $120 strike, with 15,687 calls currently in residence. Peak put OI for the series, meanwhile, totals just 7,650 contracts at the $110 strike.\nKinder Morgan Inc. (KMI)\nKMI stock was pounded once again on Friday, as traders continued to punish the shares after Moodys cut its outlook on the company from stable to negative. Kinder Morgan attempted to assuage investor concerns on Friday by stating that its dividend would remain for the current year, but KMI stockholders were having none of it, sending the shares down for a nearly 13% loss.\nKMI options traders were not quite as deaf as stock traders, as calls returned to the forefront for the stock on Friday. Total volume came in at a blistering 293,778 contracts on Friday, well above the stocks daily average for the past month. Furthermore, calls accounted for 54% of the days take. \nOptions traders have yet to fully digest KMIs recent plunge, however. Specifically, the stock is trading well below peak call and put OI strikes for the weekly December 11 series. For instance, peak call OI totals 1,720 contracts at the $20.50 strike, while peak put OI numbers 1,015 contracts at the $20 strike.\nFacebook Inc. (FB)\nFacebook was back in the headlines late last week, as the online social media giant announced it was testing live streaming sharing in select U.S. markets. The live video option launched on Thursday for iPhone users, with Facebook expected to roll out the service to Android phones later this year. \nOptions activity was brisk for FB on Friday, with 263,805 contracts changing hands on the session. Calls remained top dog for FB stock, gobbling up 70% of Fridays total volume. As for the weekly December 11 series, peak call OI totals 9,310 contracts at the overhead $107 strike, while peak put OI numbers 9,531 contracts at the $101 strike. \nAs of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\nMore From InvestorPlace\nThe Best of the Best: 6 Dividend Aristocrats to Buy\n10 Highest-Rated Stocks to Buy\n4 Top Stocks From the Tech Capital of the World\n\n\t\n\n\t\n"

S"    \n        At some point, Apple Inc. is expected to shift to organic light-emitting diode displays for the iPhone, the kind it already uses for Apple Watch. That would allow Apple to ditch backlighting for the iPhone, since pixels in an OLED screen can be individually lit.\nBut a change like that would have a big impact on Apple's current display supply chain -- and at least one supplier doesn't want to be left out.Japan Display is in talks with Apple to secure organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display orders for a 2018 handset,an iPhone 8, perhaps, according to Japanese newspaper Nikkan.\nTo prepare for a shift to a OLED-based displays, the Japanese manufacturer plans to retool one of its factories into a prototype assembly line by Spring 2016. This could put Japan Display in a much better position against a number of existing OLED display suppliers vying for Apples business.\nThe iPhone maker was also looking at Samsung as a potential display supplier for its future smartphone, according to South Korean ET News. That said, Apple already has an investment of an unspecified amount in a $1.4 billion Japan Display plant aimed at manufacturing LCD displays for the iPhone, according to Reuters.\nWere Apple to uses the display technology in its iPhone 8, it could be its second device to contain an OLED screen -- the first being the Apple Watch launched in April. LG was reportedly the sole supplier for the smartwatchs screen. But Samsung may also get a piece of the pie with the anticipated Apple Watch 2. LG is also making big investments in the OLED manufacturing business. In November, it announced its plans to spend 1.84 trillion South Korean Won (about $1.5 billion) in a plant dedicated to building OLED screens, according to the Verge.\nWhile the iPhone 8 could come with OLED display, fans wont know for sure for at least a couple of years. In the meantime, market analysts are keeping a close eye on its current smartphone -- the iPhone 6S -- and how it fares during the all-important holiday quarter.\n      \n      \n  "

S'\n                           They say a king is never late, everyone else is simply early. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) appears to follow up on this adage quite literally; the company has a knack for introducing technologies some time after everyone else in the market has and it boldly touts its offerings as the best around. The foremost example of this is that it took Apple nearly two years to introduce a phablet after its closest competitor; Samsung, captured the hearts of millions with its Note series.\nAnother example would be the recently introduced iPad Pro which is often seen as Apples answer to Microsoft Corporations (NASDAQ:MSFT) increasingly popular Surface series of tablets. The iPad Pro was launched nearly three years after Microsoft emerged as the pioneer of this hybrid device. Now that we have established that Apple follows an observatory approach before dwelling in a particular industry, we take a look at its music streaming service, Apple Music.\nWe believe that this time around, Apple has arrived too late. Apple Music has not been around for long, however it has still garnered nearly 6.5 million paid subscribers; which is certainly a commendable tally. However, still other numbers suggest that the company has a long, arduous road to traverse, if it is to emerge atop this market. By June this year, Spotify had nearly 75 million active users and that number has surely risen further. With the iPhone, Apple may have created its own exclusivity factor; but it is nowhere near the top of this market. Although Apple Music will improve with the passage of time, the truth is that so will its competitors. For Apple, the goal post is moving.\nSpotify aims to reach nearly 100 million users by the end of this year. Even if Apple grows ten times than its current standing, it can rake in just 65 million users. So it seems next to impossible for Apple to overtake Spotify. Even if Apple does grow ten times than its current standing, it will record 65 million users, still someway off from the rate at which Spotify continues to win the approval of many. We believe that unless Apple tempts users to shell out money for its Apple Music service to bring about unprecedented and exponential growth, the companys music services is likely to be chasing shadows for years to come.\nIt is speculated that Apple wont be coming close to Spotify in the near future, partially because even after five months of Apple Music having gone live, there are various bugs in iOS. Although Apple has secured exclusive deals such as Adeles record breaking 25 and Coldplays A Head Full of Dreams at the expense of Spotify, many dont wish to completely turn toward a highly bloated program, especially when options such as YouTube and Spotify exist.\nIt is no secret that Apples competitors are miles ahead in the music industry; however, there is still hope for the iPhone maker. The company has a track record of selling millions of iPhones every year, thereby indicating that it has enough users that could potentially turn to Apple Music for good. If Apple is truly serious about driving users away from other competitors, it has to rely on something more than a three-month free trial.\nSpotify has been around for years now; its fans are accustomed to the user-interface, which - to be honest - is way easier to use than Apple Music. More so, due to its position as the leader in the music industry, there appears to be significant brand loyalty among its users. It is fair to say that it is not just Apple that enjoys significant brand loyalty.\nLastly, Apple Music is not as internationally available as Spotify, not yet at least. Although this is expected to change in the coming months, the music service does not bring with itself anything that isnt already out there. Currently, Spotify is winning the one-sided battle for supremacy over the music industry, so we might just be perceived as taking sides however the numbers speak loud enough. Spotify has too much going for it; more than Apple Music can handle.                        '

S'\n                           Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has raised the track limit to 100,000 songs that can be uploaded from its iTunes Match and Apple Music services. While there has been no official announcement by Apple, users on Mac Rumors have reported that the scan-and-match feature now allows them to upload and store music libraries of more than 25,000 tracks which was the initial limit.\nThis did not come as a surprise as earlier this year, Apples senior vice president of Internet software and services, Eddie Cue, tweeted that the company was working to enlarge the storage space to support 100,000 songs in iOS9. The increase was not seen when iOS 9 debuted in September, however Apple has fulfilled its promise just in time for the holiday season.\nThis is great news for users who have huge music libraries and cannot afford the 128 GB or 64 GB iPhone models. The increase in track limit will compensate for the lack of storage space in these devices as users can now upload songs on the cloud.\nWhile for some 25,000 track limit was more than enough, quite a few found the limit unfeasible as home music collections tend to take up a lot of space. As we gradually move towards smarter technologies, every device would need more storage space. A pragmatic solution is to save the data on the cloud rather than on devices. This would make sharing and accessing content easier and more efficient.\niCloud Music Library can be accessed through iTunes Match and Apple Music, which Apple rolled out this year. Both services offer the locker feature to upload or match music in a device with the users iCloud Library. iTunes Match is available for $24.99 a year, while the Apple Music subscription costs $9.99 per month.\nApple is not the only service that allows users to store music on the cloud, Google Play Music also offers users the ability to store 50,000 tracks on the cloud and that too for free. Rather than lower rates, Apple is offering twice as much cloud storage space as its rival.                        '

Plunging oil prices appear to be the major culprit, at least according to an analysis by Reuters. There are other, more specific reasons for those holding Netflix stock to be worried, however. The firm is being shaken after a prolonged rally, and sleeping giant Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) may be about to awaken.\n\nApple is, if some reasonably well founded rumors are believed, working on a video streaming service that it wants to pair with its Apple TV set top box. The launch of that service is going to produce at least some volatility for Netflix stock as traders wonder whether or not Cupertino is going to be real competition in video streaming. Some analysts reckon that Apple, by virtue of its vast size and brand power, has already won.\nNetflix, Inc. cant compete with Apple\nFrederick Steier, an event-driven, contrarian trader who writes on Seeking Alpha, reckons that Netflix will have its value undermined by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the months and years to come. In his view its a matter of when, rather than if, Tim Cook will take Reed Hastings breakfast.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nSteier says that the biggest problem for Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) is going to be the sheer amount of cash that Apple can get its hands on. If the Cupertino firm wants to destroy Netflix it can simply flood audiences with original content, and make a one year deal for exclusive access to the best content ever made.\nIn his view streaming services only do well because of the quality of content they bring to the table. Netflix stock has risen as a result of the huge splash the firm has made in mainstream media. Apple might be able to erode that by driving up the price of third party content, while at the same time outproducing Netflix with its own shows.\nThe logic here isnt exactly concrete. Though it seems fairly clear that Apple will start its own streaming service, its not all that clear that the firm is going to get into content. A report from Variety on August 31 suggested that was indeed the plan, but, as with all Apple rumors, that should be taken with a pinch of salt.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...  Apple Inc. (AAPL) Cracks: Here\'s Why (And Why Not to Worry)At the same time, Apples entry into the market could very well increase the price of third party content, its not likely that the firm will be able to go exclusive with multiple partners. Netflix has had lots of trouble getting those kinds of deals because content owners dont want to reduce their own power in the market.\nStill, Steier reckons that if Apple wanted to, it could literally choke off Netflixs access to content. Netflix stock will suffer if thats the direction that the streaming market turns in the coming years, but theres lots of reasons to think that Apple wont be all that interested in getting rid of Netflix.\nTaking a hopeful look at Netflix stock\nMr. Steiers view is that of one man, and its hardly representative of the way traders in general see Netflix stock. Rumors of an Apple streaming service have been around for almost all of 2015, but in the last twelve months Netflix stock has more than doubled. Todays small retreat doesnt put much of a dent in the gains made by shares so far this year.\nThe Apple streaming service hasnt exactly been a home run so far. It turns out that talks to secure content on the scale that Apple is attempting arent all that easy, and it seems those talks have severely slowed the roll out of the streaming service. Initial rumors suggested that Apple would show its streaming platform to the world at WWDC in June, but it failed to appear.\nAround that time a few Wall Street research houses opined on the future of Netflix stock in a world where Apple is active. In a report published last April Morgan Stanley said that Netflix will be able to grow impressive in such a world. \nMorgan Stanley said that any saving that Apple gives to customers over cable will free up cash that they can then spend on Netflix, while at the same time the rise of an Apple streaming service would speed adoption of set top boxes and increase the direct addressable market for Netflix, Inc.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Isn\'t Secretly Backing Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) RivalsNetflix will have to compete with Apple Inc.\nThe hopeful view on Netflix doesnt mitigate the reality. Netflix is going to have to compete with Apple in the months and years to come. Though that might be good for Netflix stock in the long run, it is likely to see a lot of added volatility as it finally has to compete with a firm toe-to-toe.\nIts been quite a while since any company could really claim to compete with Netflix. Though Amazon offers Prime, the video service is a lesser part of that whole package. Apple will draw eyes away from Netflix in the years to come, but that doesnt mean that Tim Cook will want to destroy the value of Netflix stock.\nApple doesnt want to take every single market from every single player. The firm may be a hard negotiator in its dealings with music labels but it hasnt started publishing albums, even those from U2, in its fifteen years in that market. iOS is likely the most successful gaming platform out there right now, at least in terms of profitability, but Apple has sought to build the platform rather than taking the content.\nThe same goes for a whole lot of other businesses that Apple is involved in. The firm sells a lot of software through its App store, but it only competes with those firms in certain key areas.\nFor Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) its likely that Netflix is a content provider rather than a platform competitor. The streaming service can add a whole lot of value to the Apple TV platform, and there doesnt seem to be a whole lot that Apple will want to take away from Reed Hastings.\nThe Morgan Stanley view is, however, at least as speculative as that of Mr. Steier, and it really does remain to be seen what Apple is going to do with its streaming service. As Netflix stock hits all time highs day after day, now may be the time for those holding the stock to think about the future of the streaming service, and the sleeping giant that is Apple.\n\njQuery.ajax({url: "http://learnbonds.com/", data: {top_ten_id: 125506, top_ten_blog_id: 1, activate_counter: 11, top10_rnd: (new Date()).getTime() + "-" + Math.floor(Math.random()*100000)}});'

S'\n                    It is well known that in the world of high-performance, stand-alone graphics processors there are only two vendors left: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). NVIDIA has a substantial market segment share lead over AMD, with Jon Peddie Research reporting NVIDIA grabbed a whopping 81.1% market segment share in the most recent quarter.\nI believe unless AMD slashes prices of its flagship Radeon Fury X graphics chip, which many had believed would be the struggling chipmaker\'s ticket to regain share against NVIDIA, AMD may actually lose share at the high end of the graphics chip market in the coming quarters. Here\'s why.\nNVIDIA and its partners are getting very aggressive with the 980 Ti According to a number of third-party reviews, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti delivers roughly the same performance as AMD\'s flagship Radeon R9 Fury X. One of the problems for the Fury X, though, has been that GeForce GTX 980 Ti chips can typically be run at much faster speeds than what NVIDIA rates them at, which means many add-in board vendors offer GeForce 980 Ti-based graphics cards with a fairly substantial performance lead over the Fury X.\nIn contrast, it is widely accepted that the Fury X doesn\'t have much headroom beyond its rated specifications.\nEarly on, potential buyers would need to pay a premium -- in some cases, a substantial one -- for these "factory overclocked" 980 Ti cards. However, things have changed dramatically in the months since the 980 Ti and the Fury X launched.\nToday, a Radeon R9 Fury X can be had for as low as $629, with most models sitting at around $650. That may seem fine, but it\'s important to note that on Newegg.com a factory-overclocked 980 Ti can be had for as low as $599 before a $30 mail-in rebate. NVIDIA also throws in a free game, to boot.\nIt\'s very hard to make the case for the AMD Fury X at this point in light of the very aggressive pricing on NVIDIA\'s part with respect to the 980 Ti. If AMD wants to have a chance of maintaining, let alone growing, its share at the very high end of the stand-alone graphics processor market, I believe it will need to cut prices.\nCan AMD actually afford to cut prices, though? The problem for AMD is it may not have much in the way of room to cut prices while keeping its margins robust. Remember that the 980 Ti is based on a cut-down version of NVIDIA\'s GM200 GPU used in the $999 Titan X, while the Fury X is a full "Fiji" die. Given that these chips are roughly the same die size built on the same TSMC (NYSE:TSM) 28-nanometer process, NVIDIA\'s effective yields are probably better, giving it an inherently better cost structure.\nAt the same time, it\'s worth noting that the Fury X uses a newer memory technology known as High Bandwidth Memory (or HBM), while the 980 Ti uses a more mature technology known as GDDR5. I suspect at this stage of the game, GDDR5 memory is quite a bit cheaper than HBM.\nAll told, I believe it\'s cheaper to build a graphics card based on the 980 Ti than it is to build one based on the Fury X. This may make AMD reluctant to cut prices because it knows NVIDIA is much better able to handle a "price war" than AMD.\nAMD\'s reasoning for not being more aggressive on pricing is it may as well extract as much revenue as possible from customers who prefer to buy AMD products anyway.\nAMD is in a tough spot As far as high-end graphics go, I believe AMD is in a bit of a bind. NVIDIA is typically viewed as the "premium" brand while AMD is viewed by many as the "value brand." In this case, though, it looks like the "premium" vendor is offering products with equal-or-better performance at competitive price points at the high end.\nIt seems as though NVIDIA has really "won" this round of the battle. Although some AMD bulls remain hopeful the tides may turn as the two companies introduce their next-generation architectures, the fact of the matter is that NVIDIA likely dramatically outspends AMD on the development of graphics technology.\nI believe things will remain tough for AMD\'s graphics business for the foreseeable future in the face of NVIDIA\'s strong execution and sharper focus on the graphics chip market. In fact, AMD executives seem to be more interested in talking up the company\'s upcoming CPU core known as "Zen" rather than its next-generation graphics technologies. It doesn\'t seem prudent for investors to factor in material share gains in graphics as part of an investment thesis for AMD.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying.

S'\n                           Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has planned to lay off around 150 employees in Germany, which represents around 6% of the 2,700 total employees in the region, local business magazine, Wirtschaftswoche reported yesterday. The report also said that the company was planning to gather its IT support jobs at one site in Romania. It is interesting to note that the magazine did not name any source.\nThis is not the first time that layoff speculation pertaining to Oracle has emerged. Back in 2009, WSJ reported that Oracle had laid off around 500 employees in North America, citing people familiar with the matter. In 2002, Credit Suisse said the company was preparing to cut 400-800 jobs.\nIn September, Business Insider reported that Oracle was planning some cost-cutting measures such as making employees pay for holiday week between Christmas and New Years by working four days of their vacation time. The site said that employees were upset about that and blamed the setup on CEO Mark Hurd who was known for cost-cutting strategies during his tenure at Hewlett-Packard. Other cost-cutting measures were also in consideration such as reduction in car allowances.\nLayoffs by tech companies shouldnt come as a surprise as the world increasingly turns to technology to do everyday chores, with computers and robots removing the need for human input. In addition, cloud computing has eliminated the need for physical storage. Aside from this, recessions such as the one in 2008 and the most recent one in the China have left no option for companies like Oracle but to reduce headcount.\nSpecifically for Oracle, things arent going well. Its revenues fell 1.7% year over year (YoY) in the most recent quarter. Intense competition from rival, Workday Inc (NYSE:WDAY) has also added to the managements concerns. It remains to be seen whether the layoff rumour comes true.                        '

S'\n                           Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) rolled out its most affordable 4G LTE smartphone yet, when it launched the Lumia 550, a sleek $139 device, in Europe today. This is an aggressive move by the company and clearly aimed at having a larger chunk of the global smartphone market in the coming years.\nThe Lumia 550 is powered by Microsofts latest operating system, Windows 10. It operates on a 1.1 GHz quad-core processor, the Snapdragon 210, and sports a 4.7-inch 1280 x 720p HD display. The device is powered by a removable internal battery with a 2100 mAh rating.\nThe phone features a 5 MP rear camera, which has an f/1.4 autofocus lens, and can shoot videos in 720p resolution, along with a 2 MP front camera. The Lumia 550 comes with 8 GB of built-in storage, expandable up to 200 GB via MicroSD cards. It also has 1GB of processing RAM, and weighs nearly 142 grams.\nTheres a lot the Lumia 550 offers. It comes bundled with a variety of Microsoft apps and features like Office, Outlook Mail, OneDrive, Cortana, Skype and Outlook Calendar. Also, for a low-end smartphone, deep integration with the companys cloud service, OneDrive, is a major advantage. Not only does it offer users additional storage space, but also provides them an efficient way to work across numerous devices on the same file. For instance, if a user creates a Word file on his Surface Pro 4, he will just have to save it to OneDrive, in order to access it on his Lumia 550 while on his way home. For a budget-friendly device, that should make for really good user experience.\nIn the budget-friendly device category, Lumia 550 is not the cheapest one. Microsoft rolled out a $90 Lumia 532, and another $80 Lumia 435 in January. While these two were aimed at developing markets, the Lumia 550 has been launched in Europe first, ostensibly to tap on underserved markets in the region. Nevertheless, a definite statement cannot be made, since the company did mention it would launch the smartphone in other markets as well in the following weeks.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft acquired Nokias phone business for $9.4 billion, with an aim to increase its share in the smartphone market. Unfortunately, it had to later write down 80% of that transaction. CEO Satya Nadella has also redirected focus away from devices and services towards a mobile-first, cloud first strategy.\nDespite having failed with its Nokia transaction, Microsoft has not given up on the smartphone business yet. In a space largely dominated by Android and iOS, the $447 billion company aims to gain traction with its Windows 10-based smartphones. With the new operating system, the software giant ultimately aims to provide a consistently-enhanced user experience across all its devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets and the Xbox. Just like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft is on its way to create an ecosystem of Windows 10 devices, and it even has a price advantage over Apple in this regard. Looks like Windows 10 will prove the perfect OS for the company to successfully execute its mobile turnaround strategy.                        '

S'\n                    Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Zhejiang Geely\'s Volvo recently announced a partnership to develop driverless vehicles and modernize the car buying process. The companies haven\'t revealed the exact details regarding their driverless cars yet, but Volvo has stated that it will start using Microsoft\'s HoloLens in showrooms to project digital overlays over real vehicles.\n\nVolvo\'s Concept 26 driverless interior. Source: Volvo.\nThis partnership indicates that Microsoft is getting serious about connected and autonomous cars. Last April, it unveiled Windows in the Car, adashboard mirroring concept similar to Apple\'s (NASDAQ: AAPL) CarPlay and Alphabet\'s (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Android Auto. It updated that concept with Cortana integration this September, but it still hasn\'t evolved into a fully developed platform. Meanwhile, Microsoft lost ground in embedded vehicle operating systems toBlackBerry\'s QNX.\nWhat Microsoft and Volvo\'s partnership meansVolvo is a well-known brand, but it only controls 1% to 2% of the worldwide auto market. The company has already added basic autonomous features, like auto steering and following functions, to some newer models like the XC90. It also recently unveiled the "Concept 26" interior for its future driverless cars.\nIt\'s still unclear how Microsoft\'s software will be integrated into these vehicles, but the partnership with Volvo already represents more progress than Google has made. Google still hasn\'t secured any major automaker partnerships in its driverless push, but it established its own automaker, Google Auto, last year. Apple is rumored to be using a BMW frame for its long-rumored driverless car, but neither company has confirmed those reports.\n\nApple\'s CarPlay (L) and Google\'s Android Auto (R). Source: Company websites.\nMicrosoft faces a tough uphill battle in driverless cars due to its weakness in smartphones. Microsoft controls less than 3% of the global smartphone market, according to IDC, which prevents any Windows-based mirroring solutions from gaining ground against CarPlay and Android Auto.\nMicrosoft probably wants to expand its Windows 10 ecosystem to cars, but it will be difficult if CarPlay and Android Auto, which run "on top" of BlackBerry\'s QNX, become the dominant dashboards. This means that any driverless systems dependent on Apple or Google\'s ecosystems could cut Microsoft out of the loop.\nNot all hope is lostMicrosoft still has a few tricks up its sleeve, however. The company previously partnered with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) to connect drivers to automakers via connected cars. HPE\'s Automotive Aftersales CX Management Solution, which is built on Microsoft\'s Dynamics CRM, delivers data from connected cars to automakers so that they can deliver personalized offers (like infotainment, concierge services, app downloads, and fuel services) to customers.\nExpanding that foundation can encourage more automakers to connect their vehicles to Microsoft\'s cloud-based ecosystem. That data can also be extracted at the embedded OS level (where Microsoft and BlackBerry are dominant), instead of CarPlay and Android Auto\'s dashboard level.\nAnother issue is privacy. Several automakers have expressed concernsthat Google could turn driverless cars into data miners for targeted ads. That\'s probably why Audi, Daimler, and BMW agreed to buyNokia\'s HERE Maps unit in August. Like Google, HERE has been mapping out roads in "high detail" for driverless cars to navigate. But unlike Google, HERE has a fairly limited (and arguably less intrusive) advertising ecosystem. Microsoft, which isn\'t heavily dependent on advertising revenues, could exploit those privacy concerns about Google to partner with more automakers.\nMarket growth potentialMost companies believe that driverless cars will achieve mainstream adoption between 2020 and 2040. Research firm Boston Consulting Group estimates that sales of autonomous vehicle technologies could rise from nearly nothing today to $42 billion by 2025.\nIn this growing market, automakers will generate revenue by selling new cars with driverless features. Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple will profit by expanding their ecosystems into connected cars. Mobile leaders like Google and Apple have the upper hand in this battle, but Microsoft might unexpectedly secure automaker partnerships through its enterprise connections at a faster rate than either rival.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.'

S'\n          \n              \n      Summary\n    \n        Ex-CEO Steve Ballmer has complained that Windows needs to be able to run Android apps.\n        \n        Porting Android apps to Windows would have been an unqualified disaster for the company.\n        \n        Microsoft appears to be shifting its focus to a much better strategy of giving iOS developers tools for easily creating Windows apps based on their iOS projects.\n        \n        This is by far the best strategy for beefing up the Windows app store.\n        \n    \n  \n\n            \n\n\n              At Microsoft\'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent annual shareholder meeting, the company\'s biggest shareholder, Steve Ballmer, also became its most vocal critic. One of Ballmer\'s widely reported criticisms is that the company\'s strategy of universal apps for Windows 10 "won\'t work" in his words. He claimed that Windows phones need to be able to run Android apps. But the company appears to have pulled the plug on its plan to port Android to Windows 10 in order to focus on a parallel effort to port Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS apps.(click to enlarge)Source: MicrosoftWrong Again, SteveIt was at Microsoft\'s 2015 Build developer conference that the company unveiled several "software bridges" for bringing non-native apps into Windows 10. As nicely summarized in an article in Windows Central, the bridge for iOS was called Project Islandwood and the bridge for Android was called Project Astoria.The fact that Microsoft even needs to do this underscores the sorry state of the Windows Phone app store compared to its bigger Android and iOS rivals, as can be seen in this chart from Statista showing a number of apps as of July 2015:(click to enlarge)The announcements were meant to galvanize developers, but in the case of the Android bridge, Astoria, developers were displeased, according to the Windows Central article. The reason is that Android apps ran unchanged in an Android emulator, which Microsoft called a "security container."As implemented in early insider builds of Windows 10 Mobile, any user could load an Android app downloaded from the Web. There were concerns about piracy, monetization, security as well as the question of why bother developing for Windows at all. If Android apps could run unmodified in an emulator, there was really no point in developing Windows-specific versions.In fact, the promise of running unmodified Android apps in Windows was never fulfilled. As the Build conference demo made clear, developers were expected to substitute any services provided by Android OS, such as mapping and search, with the Windows equivalents.Now it appears that Astoria is on hold or perhaps dead in the water, according to Windows Central. The article cites three reasons: developer pushback, technical problems, and potential licensing issues with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).A Microsoft statement to Windows Central appears to confirm that Astoria is at least making very slow progress:We\'re committed to offering developers many options to bring their apps to the Windows Platform, including bridges available now for Web and iOS, and soon Win32. The Astoria bridge is not ready yet, but other tools offer great options for developers. For example, the iOS bridge enables developers to write a native Windows Universal app. . .According to Windows Central, Microsoft has 80 people working on the Android bridge project vs. five for iOS. That\'s probably a fair measure of the relative technical difficulty. The approach for iOS apps is completely different. iOS apps are written in one of two high-level programming languages, Objective C and Swift. Developers who use Objective C can compile their code directly into a native Windows 10 app, which can then be monetized on the Windows app store. Microsoft\'s Objective C compiler supports most but not all of the iOS APIs.I haven\'t tried out the Islandwood tool, but at Build the demo of an iOS app running on a Win10 tablet worked, whereas the demo of an Android app on a Windows 10 phone did not. Probably there\'s plenty of work for the developer to do, but less than is required for the usual cross platform development.Windows 10 and Mac OS X and iOS apps are compiled, unlike Android. Compilation takes the programming language code and converts it into the binary instructions that a computer understands. Once the app is compiled, it\'s relatively straightforward for the operating system to feed those instructions into the processor. The basic similarities between the app architectures of Windows and iOS makes porting iOS apps much easier to do.Android has a completely different app architecture in which an Android Run Time (ART) takes high level Java and C++ code and converts it into the binary code the processor understands. Each Android app runs in its own instantiation of ART. If it sounds cumbersome, it is.Why Bother?Microsoft has probably realized there\'s no reason to offer developers bridges for both iOS and Android. Almost any app that Microsoft would want on its app store is already available for iOS. That means it\'s either already available for both iOS and Android, or iOS exclusively. A developer who has both iOS and Android versions doesn\'t need both tools to port to Windows, but only one. I doubt there are any developers who have apps for both platforms who would prefer to use the Android version as their vehicle to port to Windows 10.In addition to the technical hurdles of getting an Android Run Time to work in Windows, there\'s the licensing difficulty. Microsoft would have to license ART from Google. That means paying a royalty fee to Google for every copy of Windows with ART installed. Ouch.In the case of an iOS app, Microsoft is only dealing with the source code generated by the individual developer, so no license fee gets paid to Apple. If Microsoft decides to extend the bridge to include Swift, Swift is now open source. The recent open sourcing of Swift may not be a coincidence. Apple could very well be trying to do an end run around Google by nudging Microsoft into creating a Swift compiler for Windows as well.The Enemy of My Enemy. . .A port of Android to Windows 10 would have been an unqualified disaster. The Android-based apps would have been buggy, unreliable and fraught with security issues. There\'s every indication that Microsoft has dodged this particular bullet, and Microsoft investors can heave a sigh of relief.There have been signs lately of a growing rapprochement between Microsoft and Apple. There was the appearance of Microsoft\'s Kirk Konigsbauer to demo the iOS version of Office at Apple\'s September iPhone event. And Apple\'s open sourcing of Swift seems almost a plea to Microsoft to develop a Swift compiler for Windows.Investors in both companies should welcome these developments. Enabling easier cross platform development probably serves to increase the developer pool for both companies. Sure, the companies compete on multiple fronts, but their businesses are more complementary than not. Apple is stronger in smartphones and tablets, while Microsoft is stronger in traditional personal computers as well as enterprise services.And they both have a common enemy, or at least adversary, in Alphabet. Android has become the 800-pound gorilla in the room, and anything Apple and Microsoft can do to lessen the reach of that gorilla benefits both companies.Based on Microsoft\'s y/y revenue and earnings declines in the September quarter, I can\'t really recommend Microsoft as a buy. But Microsoft has fielded some good hardware in the latest Surface Pro and Surface Book. Co-opting iOS apps is a good strategy to beef up the Windows app store. Microsoft is at least a hold.\n          \n              (function(){\n                   var disclosureHtmlStr = "<div id=\\\'article_body_top\\\' class=\\\'disclosure_top hidden\\\'><div id=\\\'inner_disclosure\\\'><!--googleoff: index--><strong>Disclosure: <\\/strong>I am/we are long AAPL. <span onclick=\\\'SA.Modules.Article.Disclosure.expand()\\\' id=\\\'more_button\\\' style=\\\'cursor:pointer\\\'><strong>(More...)<\\/strong><\\/span><span id=\\\'business_disclosure\\\' class=\\\'hidden\\\'>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

S'\n                    Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently acquired Faceshift, a Zurich-based developer of motion-capture software that lets 3D-animated characters mimic an actor\'s facial expressions. The company\'s technology was used in the latest Star Wars film, and can be live-streamed into the Unity game engine for VR environments.\n\nSource: Faceshift.\nThe terms of the deal weren\'t disclosed, but most of Faceshift\'s Swiss employees are now working for Apple. Apple didn\'t discuss its reasons for buying Faceshift, but the acquisition strongly suggests that the company is beefing up for an expansion into the augmented and virtual reality markets.\nAnalyzing Apple\'s AR and VR trailTwo years ago, Apple acquired PrimeSense, which designed the motion sensors for Microsoft\'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) first Xbox Kinect. It then filed numerous VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality) patents, including one for an iPhone-powered VR headset and another for a pair of smartglasses similar to Alphabet\'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Glass. Other patents suggest that Apple wants to put an AR overlay over Apple Maps to digitally measure distances and mark locations.\nThis March, Apple acquired AR start-up Metaio. Metaio\'s technology powers AR apps like Audi\'s digital owners manual, which identifies car parts with a camera, and IKEA\'s virtual catalog, which digitally places furniture into a user\'s living room. Metaio also holds dozens of VR-related patents. That same month, Piper Jaffray claimed that Apple had assembled a special R&D team for AR hardware. In November, the company promoted Apple Music with a 360-degree U2 music video that can be viewed through Facebook\'s (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus headsets.\nHow does Faceshift complement these moves?Buying Faceshift is an interesting move that could have interesting applications in the AR and VR markets. For example, Apple could integrate the technology into FaceTime and let users stream their facial expressions and voices to virtual avatars. Apple could open the API to developers and let them integrate Faceshift features directly into iOS games.\nOver the past year, Facebook and Google have been trying to blur the lines between real-world objects and virtual reality. Facebook recently demonstrated how two people in different rooms could play ping pong in virtual reality. Google\'sProject Tango digitizes real people and objects into computerized 3D ones, so that people can actually "touch" virtual versions of real-world objects. \nAlthough Facebook and Google generally aren\'t considered Apple\'s allies, combining Faceshift\'s facial recognition with Facebook and Google\'s spatial recognition could produce some incredible AR/VR demos.\nApple isn\'t usually the first moverFacebook and Google are both trying to generate more mainstream awareness for VR apps. Facebook recently introduced 360-degree videos that can be navigated by rotating a mobile device. Its Oculus Rift, which is scheduled to arrive next year, could be a popular accessory for hardcore gamers. Google is encouraging users to make their own Cardboard headsets to experience VR apps and 360-degree YouTube videos.\nOn the AR front, Google refuses to give up on Google Glass, its AR play, which flopped due to its awkward appearance and privacy issues. It also invested in Magic Leap, a start-up that produces AR content that can be projected onto real-world surfaces. Meanwhile, Microsoft plans to dive into the deep end of the AR market with HoloLens. Initial demos for the HoloLens are impressive, but the developer kit costs a whopping $3,000.\nApple, on the other hand, usually doesn\'t expand into fledgling markets that are still struggling to find their feet. It usually lets other companies test the waters, then disrupts the market with a device that addresses the shortcomings of older products. That\'s what Apple is likely doing right now -- collecting the tech, patents, and talent while waiting for the market to develop.\nPossibilities beyond AR and VRWhile Faceshift\'s face-tracking technology could be used for AR and VR applications, it could also be used for new features using facial recognition to unlock your phone or to improve the iPhone camera\'s ability to read emotions and smiles. Apple could also license the technology to game studios to create games.\nBut for now, investors shouldn\'t jump to conclusions about recent acquisitions like Metaio and Faceshift. Instead, they should focus on how these acquisitions might help Apple eventually expand into these markets in the near future.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.'

S'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)launched its iPhone 6s and 6s Plus barely two months ago and the world already has its sights set on their successors. A number of reliable sources have had a lot to say about the upcoming devices thus far. Likely to be called the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, from what can be gathered, the handsets promise to offer a a range of impressive features.\n\nBy considering the info leaked to the public by credible outlets and Apple suppliers, and assessing the growing market trends in the smartphone segment, so far, one can build a fairly good picture of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Here is what users can expect from next years iPhone 7 range.\nApple wants slimmer iPhones\nLet us begin with the iPhones physical appearance. It is a certain bet that the next generation of iPhones will be slimmer than prior versions. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities reported some time ago that future iPhones will be in the 6 to 6.5 millimeter range. This would be a very noticeable size drop from the thickness of the latest iPhones. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus measure at 7.1 and 7.3 millimeters respectively.\nMore from the screen\nIn terms of the iPhones display, anyone with a decent grasp of Apples innovation trends can vouch for greater resolution and upped screen size. The current iPhone has received a lot of critcism about its mediocre pixels per screen inch ratio. This is especially because other lower range devices held similar and even greater resolutions, but at lower prices. It is said that the iPhone 7 range will come in a 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch model. But yny stab at specific improvements in screen resolution at this stage would purely be speculation.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...  Apple Inc. (AAPL) Pushing Apple Pay in a War on the Wallet\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nApple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL)will stick to LCD on the iPhone 7. It has been confirmed that the iDevice maker told its supply chain to accommodate for a switch to OLED. However, the change will only take effect in two years time.\nRumors from a number of sources predict the iPhone 7 will one-up its predecessor in the 3D Touch department. A number of phone makers are working on bringing 3D touch capabilities to their own devices. As such, Apple will need to raise the bar in order to stay ahead of the curve. Sources have mentioned multi-3D touch. As opposed to normal 3D touch, multi-3D Touch would allow for pressure detection from more than one screen point at the same time. It would offer Apple the edge it needs to stay above the trend.\nThe camera\nApple made a huge leap from 8 to 12 megapixels with its latest handset range. If any camera improvement will be made on the iPhone 7 range, they are likely to be very minimal. Consumers shouldnt be surprised if Apple sticks with 12 megapixels either. However, to make up for this, it is likely that both the upcoming versions will have optical image stabilization. To-date, Apple reserves this camera feature for its iPhone Plus versions.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...  Apple Inc. iPhone 7 Specs, Release Date Blown Wide OpenFaster connectivity, faster processor\nIn terms on connectivity, future generations of the iPhone should hold improved cellular speeds. Avago, one of Apples suppliers, said that radio frequency will go up significantly for the iPhone. These advances should go a long way at boosting cellular speeds.\nLastly, a new processor. This is another one of those definite bets for the next iPhone. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming A10 should provide leading class CPU and a graphics output. KGI Securities has assured that next years version of the iPhone will see a great memory boosts. The 4.7 inch will have 2 gigs of memory and The 5.5 inch will pack 3 gigs of RAM.\n\njQuery.ajax({url: "http://learnbonds.com/", data: {top_ten_id: 125482, top_ten_blog_id: 1, activate_counter: 11, top10_rnd: (new Date()).getTime() + "-" + Math.floor(Math.random()*100000)}});'

S'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuilding on its strategic investments in heterogeneous system architecture (HSA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)announced a suite of tools designed to ease development of high-performance, energy efficient heterogeneous computing systems. The Boltzmann Initiative leverages HSAs ability to harness both central processing units (CPU) and AMD FirePro graphics processing units (GPU) for maximum compute efficiency through software. The first results of the initiative are featured this week at SC15 and include the Heterogeneous Compute Compiler (HCC); a headless Linux driver and HSA runtime infrastructure for cluster-class, High Performance Computing (HPC); and the Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability (HIP) tool for porting CUDA-based applications to a common C++ programming model. The tools are designed to drive application performance across markets ranging from machine learning to molecular dynamics, and from oil and gas to visual effects and computer-generated imaging.\nAMDs Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability enables performance portability for the HPC community. The ability to take code that was written for one architecture and transfer it to another architecture without a negative impact on performance is extremely powerful, said Jim Belak, co-lead of the U.S. Department of Energys Exascale Co-design Center in Extreme Materials and senior computational materials scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The work AMD is doing to produce a high-performance compiler that sits below high-level programming models enables researchers to concentrate on solving problems and publishing groundbreaking research rather than worrying about hardware-specific optimizations. (Original Source)\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices closed last Friday at $1.99. AMD has a 1-year high of $3.37 and a 1-year low of $1.61. The stocks 50-day moving average is $2.00 and its 200-day moving average is $2.06.\nOn the ratings front, AMD has been the subject of a number of recent research reports. In a report issued on October 26, Northland Securities analyst Gus Richard reiterated a Buy rating on AMD, with a price target of $5, which implies an upside of 151.3% from current levels. Separately, on October 16, Canaccord Genuitys Stephen Lee maintained a Hold rating on the stock and has a price target of $2.\nAccording to TipRanks.com, which ranks over 7,500 financial analysts and bloggers to gauge the performance of their past recommendations, Gus Richard and Stephen Lee have a total average return of 8.1% and 6.5% respectively. Richard has a success rate of 62.5% and is ranked #612 out of 3842 analysts, while Lee has a success rate of 50.0% and is ranked #2430.\nOverall, 3 research analysts have rated the stock with a Sell rating, 9 research analysts have assigned a Hold rating and 3 research analysts have given a Buy rating to the stock. When considering if perhaps the stock is under or overvalued, the average price target is $2.62 which is 31.7% above where the stock closed last Friday.\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc is a semiconductor company with facilities around the world. It operates in two segments: Computing Solutions and Graphics and Visual Solutions.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'

S'\n                    On Nov. 5, graphics chip specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced impressive financial results, delivering better-than-expected revenue and profit for its fiscal third quarter and guiding to a fiscal fourth quarter that was ahead of analyst consensus at the time. This significant beat was largely driven by better-than-expected sales of its gaming-oriented graphics processors.\nOf course, while the numbers in this case spoke for themselves, management offered some interesting insight into the company\'s business. Here are five points that really stood out to me on the call.\nCan NVIDIA rejuvenate its declining Quadro business? NVIDIA reported seeing sales of its professional graphics chips (Quadro products) decline 8% year-over-year. During the call, analyst Ambrish Srivastava asked management for its thoughts on what might lead to the reversal in this decline which, the analyst noted, has been happening for several quarters.\nNVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said that the market is "mature," a euphemism for a market/industry that isn\'t expected to grow by much, if at all, over the long-term. However, Huang was optimistic that NVIDA would be able to take action to "reinvent" the market in order to drive growth over the long-term.\nDriving this "reinvention" are two key technologies according to Huang. The first is a technology known as Iray, a NVIDIA-developed rendering engine that can be used with popular professional 3D content creation applications such as 3D Studio Max and Maya.\n"I think Iray is going to rejuvenate the way that people do computer graphics," Huang said. "I hope that it will increase the size of the market, make it easier for people to design products, and it will increase our [average selling prices] quite significantly."\nHuang is also bullish on virtual reality technology being important in areas such as architectural design, medical imaging, scientific computing, and entertainment, the markets that NVIDIA sells Quadro processors into.\nJen-Husn\'s view of the competitive dynamics in high end gaming graphics On the call, analyst Deepon Nag asked Huang about his view of the competitive dynamics in the high-end of the graphics processor market next year, particularly vis--vis NVIDIA\'s longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).\nAlthough Huang made it clear that he respects the capabilities of his competitors, he argues that NVIDIA is fundamentally different from Advanced Micro Devices.\n"I think it\'s also very, very clear that our business and our business model and our strategy is completely different than AMD and the PC graphics chip company we used to be a long time ago," Huang said. "And our company is just on a different trajectory."\nGiven that NVIDIA\'s gross profit margins are substantially higher than AMD\'s and that NVIDIA\'s revenue in its current fiscal year is expected to exceed AMD\'s, this is clearly a defensible claim.\n\nNVIDIA has better margins and greater revenue than AMD does. Source: YCharts.\nAdditionally, although Huang made it clear that NVIDIA remains "alert and paranoid" about any and all competitive threats, he argued that NVIDIA\'s approaches to building products, selling products, and "engaging the ecosystem" are all markedly different from AMD\'s.\nWhat\'s going on with virtual reality? Both NVIDIA and rival Advanced Micro Devices have publicly been very bullish about the opportunity that virtual reality devices present, mainly due to the fact that virtual reality tends to require substantial amounts of graphics horsepower.\nAnalyst Mark Lipacis noted on the call that NVIDIA\'s expectations seem to be "fairly low" with respect to the impact that virtual reality applications could have on its business in 2016.\nHuang said in no uncertain terms that the company is "over the top excited" about virtual reality and, from a long-term perspective, he thinks that it will be a "powerful growth driver" for the company. However, from a near-term financial perspective, Huang thinks that it\'s prudent to "wait and see" given that the technology is still so new.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone utilities, stockbrokers, record companies, bookstores, travel agencies, and big box retailers did when the Internet swept away their business models. And when cable falters, you don\'t want to miss out on these 3 companies that are positioned to benefit. Click herefor their names. Hint: They\'re not the ones you\'d think!\n\n\n\n                    \n                '

Overall, we maintain our belief NVIDIAs transformation from a PC-leveraged GPU supplier to a diverse visualcomputing company is nearing completion with growth and overall earnings power now driven by the companys four target growth markets of gaming, enterprise, HPC/ cloud, and automotive. While we have applauded and appreciated the companys transformation, our fundamental thesis has obviously underestimated the strength of key themes driving NVIDIAs strong recent results including augmented/virtual reality, eSports, and automotive display/control, as well as the companys position within these markets.\nThe analyst continued,Given concerns over the imminent end of Intels royalty payments, potential convertible debt conversions and premium valuation remain, we remain HOLD rated for now; however, we plan a full re-examination of our fundamental thesis and valuation parameters in light of NVIDIAs current business trends.\nAccording to TipRanks.com, which measures analysts and bloggers success rate based on how their calls perform, analyst Matt Ramsay has a total average return of -0.3% and a 54.5% success rate. Ramsay is ranked #2758 out of 3827 analysts.\nOut of the 18analysts polled by TipRanks, 8rate Nvidia Corporation stock a Buy, while 10rate the stock a Hold.With a downside potential of 8.03%, the stocks consensus target price stands at $28.87.\n\nSkyworks Solutions Inc\nIn a research report issued today,Canaccord analyst Michael Walkleyreiterated a Buy rating on Skyworks Solutionsshares,with a price target of $132,after thecompanyreported better-than-expected results for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and issued guidance ahead of the Streets consensus.\nWalkleywrote, Despite some weak trends in September quarter global smartphone sales, we believe Skyworks strong results and guidance were driven by RF content share in the iPhone 6 and Samsungs Galaxy S6 smartphones combined with our belief Skyworks gained at least 15% additional content share in the new iPhone 6S smartphones. We also believe growing sales of higher dollar content integrated solutions to Chinese smartphone OEMs contributed to the strong results and guidance. Also, growing traction in its non-handset broad markets business that grew 20% Y/Y in F2015 helped drive the strong results and margins.\nFurthermore, We believe Skyworks broad portfolio of custom integrated solutions should enable dollar content share growth in leading premium tier smartphones from Apple and Samsung and also enable Skyworks to grow content share in the fast growing Chinese LTE smartphone market. We also believe Skyworks diverse analog portfolio positions its broad market division for 20% plus annual growth driven by content share in markets such as 802.11ac, wireless infrastructure, and the IoT market.\nAccording to TipRanks.com, analyst Michael Walkley has a total average return of 17.3% and a 63.5% success rate. Walkley has a 50% average return when recommending SWKS, and is ranked #11 out of 3827 analysts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'

S'\n                    When Ruth Porat was hired earlier this year as CFO by the company then known as Google and now known as Alphabet, a primary objective was to help the search giant "invest in a thoughtful, disciplined way in our next generation of big bets." Those "big bets," or "moonshots" as they\'re sometimes referred to, include new gadgets and solutions developed in the secretive Google X labs and its life sciences unit, to name a couple. Now, Porat is prepared to address Alphabet\'s rampant spending, but will it be enough?\nTo the dismay of many investors and industry pundits, Alphabet\'s Google X and other cutting-edge pursuits have for too long been associated with a lot of overhead, and very little to show in return. The self-driving cars, Google Glass, and nano-technology designed for use in the healthcare industry are "neat," but some fear the efforts detract from what Alphabet does best: generate nearly $17 billion in advertising revenue, as it did in Q3.\nWhat\'s the big deal? Part of the problem with Alphabet\'s continued pushing of the innovation envelope is that it is nearly impossible to determine just how much of its $6.93 billion in operating expenses last quarter went to fund its moonshots, compared to how much was spent to grow revenue. Investors aren\'t enamored with uncertainty, but they have been forced to live it when dealing with Alphabet and its "big bets." But that\'s about to change.\nPay to playIn addition to monitoring spending for Alphabet\'s far-flung efforts, Porat has already made strides in managing expenses, but she recognizes that clarity is needed. As Porat said in an October conference call, "after a period of big expense buildup, there was an appreciation that we needed to manage the cadence of spend." That seems to be CFO-speak for opening Alphabet\'s books so investors can see what it\'s spending for those Project Loon balloons, delivery drones, and other wild notions.\nAs Alphabet continues its transformation into a tech conglomerate, it will now reportedly require its moonshot divisions to pay for the services the units utilize, including marketing and computing support. Paying for corporate services, and reporting those expenses once the new financial structure is unveiled next year, could be viewed as a means of reining in costs and appeasing investors by sharing expense particulars.\nDeveloping distinct financial statements for Alphabet\'s various enterprises would also position the units to be spun off. And operating as distinct businesses with an end goal of becoming independent entities is more than just idle talk. "We are very much thinking [Google divisions] will continue to grow and beindependententities," Porat said during Alphabet\'s Q3 conference call last month.\nAlphabet is not alone Alphabet is hardly the only digital advertiser pushing the innovation envelope. It was just a few months ago that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) took the wraps off its own mini-moonshot when it unveiled its first solar-powered drone. The objective is to further CEO Mark Zuckerberg\'s Internet.org initiative to bring connectivity to the world\'s under-served masses.\nIn addition to its odd-looking Loon balloons, Alphabet has its own drones to accomplish much the same things as Facebook. Connecting the world to the Internet serves a couple of purposes for both digital advertising behemoths. One, it\'s a philanthropic effort that will quite likely change the Internet-using landscape for the better. Two, both Facebook and Alphabet will benefit as more users come online. More users translate to more opportunities to do what each does best: sell digital advertising to their marketing partners.\nBut contact lenses with a minibuilt-in camera, a teleportation device, or hoverboards? What are the chances that the investment of time, manpower, and money that Alphabet has sunk into all of those off-the-wall endeavors actually realizes any revenue, let alone profits? Unfortunately, despite the decision to share the expenses of its divisions, investors shouldn\'t expect spending on its moonshot projects to slow anytime soon.\nAppeasing investors by shedding some light on overhead is a good first step. However, it\'s telling that CEO Larry Page also has another plan in mind: increase spending in areas including healthcare and transportation solutions. When it\'s said and done, Alphabet\'s decision to charge its divisions for its services and subsequently share those costs sounds good, but the rampant spending on moonshots will continue. The only difference is that soon, investors will know how much.\n\nThis $19 trillion industry could destroy the InternetOne bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. It could make early investors wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...The Economist is calling it "transformative"...but you\'ll probably just call it "how I made my millions." Don\'t be too late to the party -- click here for one stock to own when the Web goes dark.\n\n                    \n                '

This low level of complacency in option prices many times is indicative of a intermediate-term top in GOOGL.\n\nClick to EnlargeShorting GOOGL is a risky proposition, and certainly expensive from a margin standpoint. Instead, I would employ some defined risk option strategies to position for a pullback in GOOGL at a much lower level of capital commitment and risk.\nGOOGL Stock Trade Ideas\nWith IV, and therefore option prices, at comparatively cheap levels, I favor long option strategies. My trade structure is a put diagonal spread, buying the GOOGL Jan $740 puts and selling the GOOGL Dec $720 puts for a $10 net debit. The risk on the trade is the $10 net debit, with the initial position being net short 14 deltas.\nIdeally, GOOGL stock closes near $720 at December expiration to realize the maximum gain. If GOOGL stock closes above this level at expiration, additional shorter-term puts can be sold against the long Jan $740 puts to further hedge and reduce the initial cost, while still maintaining a bearish stance.\nAs of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

S'\n                    Alphabet\'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Chromecast is the best-selling media-streaming device in the world, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. The firm estimates that Google\'s device claimed 35% of the market during the third quarter, followed by 20% for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV and 16% for both Amazon\'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV and Roku\'s devices. \n\nGoogle\'s new Chromecasts. Source: Google.\nThe 9.2 million streaming devices shipped in the quarter accounted for 17% of all shipments of "connected TV" devices, which also include smart TVs, Blu-ray players, and game consoles. Strategy Analytics estimates that total shipments of connected TV devices will grow 17% annually to 221 million units for the full year. What does Google\'s lead in this growing market mean for rivals like Apple and Amazon?\nGoogle\'s streaming strategyGoogle is approaching the connected TV market with two platforms: Android TV and Chromecast. With Android TV, Google relies on OEMs to manufacture Android-powered smart TVs and set-boxes that download apps and media content from Google Play. This platform replaces Google TV, a similar effort that flopped due to delayed Android integration and resistance from content providers. Android TV products, which are comparable to Apple TV and Fire TV, are notably pricier and less popular than Chromecast.\nWith Chromecast, Google "casts," or mirrors, mobile apps, media, or Chrome content to a $35 dongle connected to the TV. This strategy targets customers who simply want to mirror content from their mobile devices at the lowest possible price. Certain iOS and Android games can also be mirrored onto the TV, allowing the smartphone to be used as a Wii-like controller. \nChromecast\'s direct competitors include Amazon\'s Fire TV Stick and Roku\'s Streaming Stick, which both cost a little more. In late September, Google launched two new puck-shaped Chromecasts -- one for video and apps, and another for audio streaming. \nWhy the Chromecast is popularThe popularity of Chromecast indicates that customers like simple streaming solutions that use their smartphones or tablets as central hubs. Bigger set-top boxes cost more because they are equipped with more powerful hardware, which isn\'t necessary for mirroring-only solutions.\nFor casual gamers, playing a downloaded game on a $149 Apple TV or $100 Fire TV might not be all that different from playing an iOS or Android game being mirrored to the Chromecast. The new Chromecast also offers more flexible gaming options. For example, a player with an Android device can play a multiplayer game with an iPhone owner if both players cast their displays to the Chromecast. \n\nThe new Apple TV. Source: Apple.\nThe Chromecast isn\'t a major source of revenue for Google. Based on Strategy Analytics\' third-quarter estimates, Google probably sold 1.8 million Chromecasts at $35 each, which equals $63 million in revenue (0.3% of its third-quarter revenues). Instead, it\'s an ecosystem play. By keeping an eye on the apps and media content that users stream to the Chromecast, Google gains more information to craft targeted ads, which strengthens its core advertising business.\nDon\'t count Apple and Amazon out yetBut before Alphabet investors declare victory in the streaming device wars, they should note that things could change during the fourth quarter. Apple\'s aggressive marketing of the new Apple TV could boost holiday sales against the Chromecast. Amazon\'s decision to stop selling Apple TV and Chromecast devices could also hurt Chromecast sales, since the Chromecast was one of its top-selling consumer electronics devices.\nApple and Amazon also have different reasons for selling streaming devices. For Apple, the Apple TV could generate more digital revenues through media and app purchases, and serveas a base for Apple Music and its long-rumored streaming TV service. These digital revenues could diversify Apple\'s business away from iPhones, which generated over 60% of its revenue last quarter. \nAmazon is using its set-top boxes to keep users dependent on its Prime ecosystem. Without a Prime membership, Fire TV users can\'t access Amazon\'s library of TV shows, films, and music. But once customers pay $99 per year for the service, studies show that they buy more digital and physical products. Earlier this year, research firm CIRP claimed thatthe average Prime member spends $1,200 annually on the site, compared to $700 for nonmembers.\n\nThe new Fire TV. Source: Amazon.\nUpcoming battlesGoogle has a good lead in the streaming market, but I\'m not certain that it will last as full-featured streaming devices become smaller and cheaper. I also think that Apple\'s brand power and Amazon\'s massive ecosystem could curb Google\'s early growth. Either way, connected TVs will become a key battleground for these tech giants over the next few years.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

S"\n                    \nSquare just released a new NFC reader. Will it have to develop another one in the near future? Image source: Square.\nOver the past week, speculation has intensified that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is preparing to kill the traditional 3.5 millimeter headphone jack in its never-ending quest for the thinnest and lightest iPhone it's ever made. Japanese blog Macotakara is reporting that the iPhone 7 will abandon the headphone jack and instead integrate audio directly into the Lightning connector.\nThis isn't an entirely new rumor, as Apple introduced specifications to integrate audio signals into Lightning in the summer of 2014 as part of its MFi accessory certification program. Around the same time, there was talk that Apple was making Lightning versions of its own EarPods as well. But the very fact that these rumors have now resurfaced gives that much more credibility to the possibility that Apple is indeed about to axe the jack.\nAs expected, this move has potentially massive implications for Apple's army of third-party accessory makers that participate in its MFi program. That could also apply to freshly public Square (NYSE:SQ), which famously commandeered the headphone jack for mobile payments.\nTime to sign up for MFiSquare's innovative Magstripe Reader has long been its claim to fame, allowing anyone to accept credit card payments through the headphone jack of a smartphone. As such, the company could stand to lose if Apple ditches Square's primary interface method. Note that Square has never participated, nor has it needed to, in Apple's official MFi program. Square built its technology on standard 3.5 mm headphone jacks, where it doesn't need to worry about licensing fees or proprietary standards.\nBut if Apple kills the headphone jack, there's a distinct possibility that Square will need to sign up for MFi if it wants to develop a Lightning-compatible Magstripe Reader. None of this is to suggest that Apple might kill Square altogether, but it could hurt Square in the form of increased development costs related to its hardware. Square has long incurred losses on its hardware upfront in an effort to expand its installed base, which in turn grows payments volume. Negative gross margins for hardware sales are simply a necessary evil.\n\nData source: SEC filings.\nThe market is evolving, though, and Square will need to keep up. The company recently released a new NFC contactless and chip card reader that it sells for $49, in part to support Apple Pay as well. Square has always given away its Magstripe Readers for free, and charging $49 for the new reader shows that the development wasn't cheap. If Square now needs to consider signing up for MFi and allocating resources to developing a Lightning-compatible reader, we're talking about even more R&D dollars that will continue to weigh on hardware gross margins.\nNever look backThe good news is that Square likely has plenty of time to adapt. Even if Apple follows through with making the iPhone 7 the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever made by abandoning the traditional headphone jack, it's not as if the entire mutual customer base will upgrade overnight. Many of Square's small and local merchants will still have the same iPhones that they've always used to process payments.\nBut if there's anything we know about Apple, it's that once it turns its back on an antiquated technology, it never looks back. All future iPhones would lack the headphone jack, and as newer models infiltrate the market, Square will eventually need to come up out with a new reader. But at what cost?\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.\n                    \n                "

S'\n                           Market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) released a new report on wearable devices market share yesterday. The firm has discussed all wearable devices, including fitness trackers and smartwatches. As part of that report, IDC said that even though Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has the highest smart watch sales, its shipment volume still lags behind that of Fitbit.\nStrategy Analytics reported in October that Apple had reportedly shipped 4.5 million smartwatches during the third quarter of 2015 (3QFY15), still remaining behind Fitbits 4.7 million shipment volume for the period. With the highest market share and sales, Fitbit clearly remains the dominant player in the wearable tech market. Apple comes second, and Chinese vendor Xiaomi ranks third in the market.\nApparently, Fitbit leads the wearable tech market with its low prices. Fitbit fitness trackers are typically priced within a $100-180 range, comparatively much lower than that of other vendors. However, it is still higher than that of Xiaomi; at $80, Xiaomi is currently offering the cheapest fitness trackers. Considering this, the Chinese giants 815% year-over-year (YoY) increase in shipments does not seem astounding. As for Apple, at a base price of $350, it has seemingly benefited the most, given that it managed to capture an 18.6% market share within only a year since it launched the Apple Watch.\n\nIDC also stated that while Samsung, Pebble, Motorola, and Apple have led to an increase in smartwatch sales, this has not caused a decrease in fitness tracker sales. As shipments for both categories of wearable devices increased quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) as well as YoY, it shows that both categories can co-exist. This also benefits consumers, as they have more choice: from simple fitness gadgets to full-fledged smartphone-type experience.\nAccording to the report, Apples smartwatch shipments increased sequentially due to growth in other markets including China and India. It also said that consumers were more inclined towards the Apple Watch Sport, as it was the cheapest variant. As a result, the tech giant launched Gold and Rose Gold versions for the Sport lineup. It also released the watchOS 2, which now provides support for third-party applications.\nFitbit Inc. (NYSE:FIT) currently leads the wearables market with a 22.6% share. Its Fitbit Charge and Fitbit Surge models were the highest-selling ones over the year. The San Francisco-based company has also made great strides in the corporate sector. More than 70 Fortune 500 companies, including the likes of Time Warner, Bank of America, and Target have ordered Fitbit devices for their employees. Target alone has ordered 335,000 fitness trackers from Fitbit.\nSince the report covers both smartwatches and fitness trackers, it is hard to figure out Apples precise position the wearables market. However, IDC is reportedly working on a new report that will categorize wearables separately from smartwatches, giving readers a better idea of which company stands where. For now, it seems likely that Apple will continue playing second-fiddle to Fitbit in the wearable tech market.                        '

The analyst might be taking the entire electric car segment or just the infotainment systems and human-machine interfaces.\nEarlier this year, an article from USA Today claimed that Apples secretive Project Titan is not full automobile.

S"\n                           Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shares have gained more than 7% in the last five days, primarily because of increased investor confidence. The chipmaker has awarded shareholders with some motivating reports in its annual analysts day, raising quarterly cash dividends along with its full-year 2016 outlook.\nIntel's shares have faced the brunt of investor concerns in the past couple of months, mainly because of its reliance on the weak PC market. However, in a bid to reduce its exposure on the underperforming PC sector, Intel acquired a programmable chipmaker, Altera Corporation. Moreover, the company also revealed its intentions of returning to the memory chipmaking business alongside veteran memory chipmaker Micron Technology, in an attempt to seek new revenue streams.\nAdditionally, Intel announced plans to splash over $5.5 billion to transform its old factory in China to manufacture its highly anticipated 3D Xpoint Technology. Analysts at Northland Capital weighed in on Intel, reiterating its Outperform rating along with a 12-month price target of $39. The research firm maintained its bullish stance on the stock, highlighting its strong IP portfolio.\nAnalysts at Northland Capital remain confident over the coming 3D Xpoint technology and believe that the company is taking all the right steps in re-entering the memory chipmaking business. The research firm highlighted the upcoming technology as a technological game changer in the long run. Northland Capital believes that Intels re-entry into the memory business at this time will be positive for the chipmaker as it can further claim sizeable tax incentives by upgrading its older fab into a NAND plant in China. At the other end, the company has recently made its entry into the Kangaroo market with its dual bond offering.

S"\n                    \nImage source: Apple.\nThis holiday shopping season will be an important test for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)since it will be the first shopping season for Apple Watch. Apple doesn't enter new product categories very often, but when it does it jumps in with both feet and always makes a splash.\nAs the first new category that Apple has entered in the Tim Cook era, the wearable device is especially symbolic as to how well Apple can innovate post-Jobs. With Apple already one of the top players in the wearables market, its performance will also be representative of the broader product category.\nThe good news is that retailers are already aggressively promoting Apple Watch, offering the device with hefty Black Friday discounts along with other gadgets, andIBM Watson says Apple Watch is at the top of many shopping lists. If you wanted to be cynical, you might argue that Apple's distribution channels and retail partners are trying to clear out inventory if sales thus far have been underwhelming. Investors won't know for sure since Apple won't disclose anything. Apple doesn't even indicate whether or not Apple Watch channel inventory is within management's target range like it does for other product categories.\nLet's see what the Street has to say.\nWord on the StreetFBR Capital analyst Daniel Ives is out with a research note after conducting some store checks during the Black Friday weekend. Ives says that consumer interest for Apple Watch at retail stores is on the rise. The analyst is modeling for Apple Watch to sell 5 million to 6 million units during the December quarter.\nApple has a very strong chance to drive adoption of wearable technology in the years ahead, an opportunity that Ives estimates at over $20 billion over the next three years. As the installed base grows and Apple's overall ecosystem strengthens, enterprise opportunities will subsequently arise.\nFor what it's worth, Ives believes that Apple has shipped 6 million Apple Watch units to date following the April launch. Apple has said that the device was severely supply constrained during the first two months of availability, however.\nReading between the linesIf Ives' models prove accurate, then Apple will have shipped upward of 12 million Apple Watch units in 2015. Compare that to the 6.8 million total smartwatches sold in 2014 or the 18.4 million fitness trackers and smartwatches that Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) has sold over the past four quarters, and you can see that Apple is quickly becoming an influential player. Fitbit is currently the wearables market leader, but Apple threatens to dethrone the freshly public company. This is partly why Fitbit is aggressively moving upmarket into smartwatch territory by adding more and more features to its devices.\nI believe that Apple Watch average selling prices are likely in the range of $450 to $500, which would imply Apple Watch revenue of $2.3 billion to $3 billion in the December quarter, based on Ives' unit estimates. Even though that total isn't especially significant financially relative to Apple's overall results, it would be a huge uplift for Apple's other products category. Other products generated $3 billion in revenue last quarter, so if Apple sells $3 billion worth of Watches alone it will enjoy a healthy jump.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

S'\n                    iPhone 6s. Photo: Apple\nLow-cost smartphones have come a long way in recent years.For less than $200, consumers can purchase critically acclaimed handsets powered by Alphabet\'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android, like Motorola\'s Moto G or Xiaomi\'s Redmi 2. They certainly don\'t offer the same level of performance or features as a $649 flagship, but they\'re capable of accomplishing most tasks.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has long resisted the urge to release a low-cost iPhone. It discounts older models, but only slightly: the iPhone 5s, at $450, is still considerably more expensive than the average Android smartphone. This isn\'t much of a problem in developed economies, where consumers are able to afford Apple\'s high prices, but it limits emerging market demand. In the past, analysts have regularly called on Apple to release a cheap iPhone aimed at this market -- but those calls have been ignored.\nStill, Apple\'s management sees the value in expanding the total number of iPhone owners. On the company\'s last earnings call, it laid out an alternative strategy -- one that could help put more iPhones in the hands of budget-constrained consumers.\nA byproduct of more frequent upgradesApple is expected to sell around 70 million iPhones this quarter. Some of those handsets will go to first-time smartphone owners, but most buyers -- especially in the U.S. -- will be upgrading from an existing smartphone (and more often than not, an older iPhone). Those used smartphones could be headed to junk drawers or landfills, but an increasing number will make their way to emerging markets.\nFirms like Gazelle, Glyde, HYLA Mobile, and Brightstar have been buying and selling used iPhones for years. Generally, phones are purchased from wireless carriers ordirectly from consumers in developed economies, then resold in emerging markets. If you participated in an iPhone trade-in program anytime this year, someone in Vietnam or Bangladesh might be using your old handset at this very moment.\nHistorically, however, most consumers have held on to their old handsets, even if they didn\'t intend to use them. In 2013, HYLA Mobile (via Bloomberg) estimated that only 15% of consumers traded in their old smartphones when they purchased new ones. That figure has likely risen in the last two years, and should rise significantly in the quarters to come.\nNew plans adopted by U.S. wireless carriers that allow for more frequent upgrades also force consumers to trade in their old handsets. Verizon will give iPhone 6s owners the ability to upgrade to an iPhone 7 next year, but only if they\'re willing to trade in their existing iPhone. The same is true for similar plans from T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T. The popularity of these early upgrade programs is expected to rise in the coming months -- Piper Jaffray believes more than half of U.S. iPhone owners will soon begin upgrading on an annual basis. That should mean tens of millions more used iPhones available to emerging market consumers.\nU.S. wireless carriers remain the driving force behind this shift, but similar plans are increasingly being offered in other countries, and by Apple itself.\nA boon for the App Store and Apple\'s platformApple\'s CEO Tim Cook spoke about this trend on the company\'s most recent earnings call, arguing that it should provide a significant tailwind for Apple\'s App Store business.\n\n"I would also point out that some of these upgrade programs that are in the market, they sort of began to look more like a subscription business in terms of the way they operate...we think that, in the aggregate, that they may reduce upgrade cycles...also, the iPhone that has been sold to someone else hits the price point that we\'re not hitting today, largely, which could help further fuel the services revenue which we did quite well on last quarter."\n\nLater in the call, Cook reiterated the point, arguing that used iPhones could provide tough competition for handsets powered by Alphabet\'s mobile operating system:\n\n"We do like the fact that [early upgrade programs create] a market for...iPhone at a different price point...[that used iPhone is probably a] better product than [what the] customer may be currently buying, which would further help from an ecosystem point of view and that\'s not to be underestimated."\n\nA used iPhone sold to a consumer doesn\'t benefit Apple\'s iPhone business directly, as it collects no revenue on the sale, but it does benefit the company in other ways. A consumer who buys a used iPhone might still purchase some apps from the App Store.Apple\'s Services segment, which includes the iTunes app store, is now Apple\'s third-largest business. Last quarter, it generated almost 10% of Apple\'s total revenue, rising 10% on an annual basis.\nThe growing number of used iPhones available in these markets could cannibalize some of Apple\'s own iPhone sales, but given the high price of new iPhones, it\'s more likely that they\'ll steal business from low-cost Android vendors. Alphabet\'s mobile operating system powers about 81% of the smartphones sold globally, with most of its success attributable to emerging market buyers. There won\'t be enough used iPhones available to make a significant dent in Android\'s market share, but every additional iPhone user helps as the iOS platform becomes that much more attractive to mobile developers.\nUsed iPhones may not be the emerging market answer analysts were looking for, but it seems to be the one they\'ll get.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

S'\n                    One of the best sources on the Web for learning about the performance and capabilities of the displays found on premier mobile devices is DisplayMate. The author, Dr. Raymond Soneira, generally publishes extremely detailed performance tests and measurements of the latest mobile displays and offers insight into what the future for mobile displays might bring.\nIn his review of the displays found on the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 6/6 Plus, the display expert argued that next generation mobile displays would benefit from expanded color gamuts (beyond the sRGB standard, which most good mobile displays implement these days), or the range of colors that a particular display can actually show.\nAccording to Soneira, OLED displays -- which Apple will reportedly begin to use in its iPhones beginning in 2018 -- can offer wide color gamuts. Traditional LCDs, on the other hand, require new technologies to display a wider range of colors.\nSoneira is quite bullish on Quantum Dot LCDs, a technology that enables LCDs to display much wider color gamuts than traditional LCDs can. However, if Apple chooses to widen the color gamut in its next-generation iPhone displays, I don\'t think it will use Quantum Dots (I\'ll tell you why shortly).\nHere\'s what it could do instead.\nSay, what about that technology in the new iMac? Apple recently refreshed its Retina 5K iMac line and introduced a new Retina 4K iMac. One of the key selling points for these two computers is that the display is able to show a wider color gamut than traditional sRGB known as P3.\nAccording to an article written by Steven Levy, Apple chose not to use Quantum Dots in its Retina 4K and 5K iMac displays due to the fact that this technology requires the use of the toxic element cadmium.\nInstead, according to KGI Securities\' Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple\'s display suppliers are using a new LED phosphor to display this expanded range of colors. In the aforementioned interview, Apple\'s John Ternus said this technology allowed Apple to get its wider color gamut "without the environmental downside."\nI think this technology might be exactly what Apple and its suppliers implement in the display that shows up in the next generation iPhones.\nWhy such a move could make sense Although I have no special information about Apple\'s iPhone 7/7s display plans, I think such a move would make sense given Apple\'s recent history.\nFor example, the company first introduced a Force Touch trackpad as part of its new 12-inch MacBook as well as its 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro computers earlier this year. Apple then brought that technology to the (much higher volume) iPhone several months later.\nIndeed, display quality is a key part of the smartphone experience. In order for Apple to be able to grow sales year over year in the coming iPhone cycle, the company must, in my view, deliver big improvements in the display, as big improvements there will be among the first things potential customers notice as they look at the new devices and compare them to their current ones.\nHigher display resolution and pixel density are certainly one very marketable thing that Apple could pursue with its next generation iPhones (and I suspect both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will see display resolution increases from the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, respectively), but a wider color gamut might be an even better way to "wow" said potential customers.\nIndeed, in the Levy piece linked earlier, Ternus was quoted as saying that professionals can immediately see the improvement that a wider color gamut brings and that laymen will "look at it and say, \'Gee, I don\'t really know why, but it looks better.\'"\nThat\'s exactly the kind of thing, if witnessed in person, that could convince users of older smartphones, particularly those who aren\'t quite sure if they want to upgrade, to pull the trigger on a new iPhone.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying.

S'\n                    Popular Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) focused website Patently Apple recently put out a piece pondering whether the Mac maker\'s upcoming 12-inch MacBook will use either a next generation A10X processor (the successor to the A9X found inside of the iPad Pro) or a next generation Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core M processor.\nI believe Apple will stick to an Intel processor rather than transition to an in-house chip. Here\'s why.\nIntel\'s financial guidance provides a really good hint According to the usually right Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via AppleInsider), the 12-inch MacBook is now Apple\'s best-selling PC product, with the 13-inch MacBook Pro coming in second. If this is the case, then I believe that if Intel had lost the spot in the next MacBook (something Intel would know at this point), such a development would have had a material impact on the Chipzilla\'s financial guidance for 2016.\nAt its most recent investor meeting, Intel said it expects revenue in its client computing group (CCG) to be anywhere from flat to up by a "low single-digit" percentage from 2015 levels. In light of this guidance, it\'s hard to believe Intel has lost its spot in the next generation MacBook.\nOther reasons why such a move would be impractical In order for Apple to release a MacBook with an A-series processor, it would need to make sure that all of the applications potential customers are interested in running have been rebuilt by developers to work on an ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) based processor.\nApple would have little trouble in moving over its own applications; it would cost time, money, and manpower, but Apple is certainly capable of porting over native X86 applications to the ARM instruction set on an ARM-compatible version of iOS.\nThe bigger challenge, in my view, would be in getting third-party developers to port their applications over. Apple could certainly work with big developers to move their code over, but not all applications from the many different software vendors will be ready by the early 2016 timeframe (which is when I\'d expect a new MacBook to launch).\nTo work around this, Apple would need to introduce some sort of emulation capability, similar to what Intel did on Android in order to support the execution of ARM-native apps. In applications that require emulation in order to run, I would expect a significant performance penalty relative to a native implementation running on an Intel processor and, if the application requires a reasonable amount of performance, a real degradation in user experience.\nDon\'t expect Intel to lose this spot anytime soon Although I do think Apple could handle going through a messy architecture transition on the Mac, I think the risk/reward for such a move is quite poor.\nIntel already makes best-in-class low-power PC processors and I expect that the performance/features of its Core M product family will only get better out in time as future designs target a roughly 5-watt power envelope from the start (my understanding is that this requirement was added fairly late in the development cycle of the most recently launched Core M chips).\nThe only way I see Intel really losing a spot to an Apple-designed chip inside of future MacBooks is if Apple loses faith in Intel\'s PC product pipeline. But if Intel can continue to deliver on significantly improved chip designs with each generation, I just don\'t see such a transition away from Intel happening for the Mac.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying.

(AAPL)\nFBR Capital reiterated AAPL stock with an outperform rating on Friday after analyst Daniel Ives said that data showed increasing interest in the Apple Watch. Per Ives report, this morning, we heard of ramping interest/sales among consumers based on our conversations at various Apple, Target, and Best Buy stores. Apple has struggled in recent months due to perceptions of a lukewarm reception for the Apple Watch. A turnaround in holiday sales for the wearable could be big for AAPL stock.\nOption volume was brisk on AAPL for a holiday session. More than 254,000 contracts traded on the stock, with calls accounting for 63% of total volume. Turning to weekly December 4 series options, AAPL options traders have maintained their attention on the overhead $120 and $121 strikes, with 17,762 contracts and 11,177 contracts open at each, respectively. As for puts, 10,766 contracts reside at the out-of-the-money $110 put strike.\nFacebook Inc. (FB)\nFB stockholders had a lot to crow about last week. The company formed a partnership with Alphabet to help the FB app with indexing on Android devices. The deal boosts FBs app presence on Android and aids Google in acquiring key data on mobile user search. Additionally, MKM Partners highlighted Facebook as a leader in the VR market it estimates to be worth $10 billion by 2020. Facebooks Oculus Rift is expected to roll out in the first quarter of 2016.\nFB options traders werent shy with call options on Friday. Volume topped out at 122,230 contracts on the session, with calls accounting for 72% of the days take. As for the weekly December 4 series, FB options traders currently hold significant open positions at the overhead $107 strike (8,114 contracts) and the $106 strike (6,037 contracts). Put activity has been considerably less brisk, with peak OI totaling just 3,211 contracts at the $104 strike, with another 3,501 contracts at the $102 strike.\nWalt Disney Co. (DIS)\nESPN continues to hemorrhage subscribers, with the latest reports underscoring the evaporation of 3 million subscribers during the most recent fiscal year. Disney is calling the declines modest, but analysts and DIS stockholders are becoming increasingly nervous amid this growing trend. \nDespite low overall volume in the options pits, DIS saw above average short-term volume on Friday. A total of 102,874 contracts traded on the session, with calls maintaining a slight edge with 57% of the overall take. For the December 4 series, options traders have loaded up on $110 puts on DIS, with OI totaling 10,537 contracts. By comparison, peak call OI for the December 4 series totals just 3,133 contracts at the $120 strike.\nAs of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\nMore From InvestorPlace\nThe Only 6 Energy Stocks With A Ratings\n5 Bank Stocks to Sell on Rate Hike Fears\n8 Beat the Market Stocks to Buy\n\n\t\n\n\t\n"

S'\n                    \nApple\'s iPad Pro. Image source: Apple.\nIt is well-known that Apple\'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad business has been in decline for a couple of years. Market observers generally cite a relatively long tablet-replacement cycle coupled with cannibalization of the iPad by larger iPhones as key reasons for the recent declines in iPad sales.\nHowever, back in October, well-respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities argued that the "worst is over for iPad." The analyst thinks that iPad average selling prices are poised to rise as a result of sales of the iPad Pro, which should serve to offset continued unit declines.\nI think this argument makes a lot of sense. Here\'s why.\niPad Pro already starts expensive and there\'s all the reason to buy up The iPad Air 2 starts at $499 (16-gigabyte model with Wi-Fi) all the way up to $829 for a 128-gigabyte version with both Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity.\nThe iPad Pro with 32 gigabytes of memory starts at $799, with the next model up sporting 128 gigabytes of storage and selling for $949. Apple doesn\'t offer a cellular version of the 32-gigabyte model, but the 128 gigabyte model with cellular goes for an eye-popping $1,079.\nWhat\'s interesting is that there\'s no middle option. For $799, a user is able to get a really fast, well-built device that is almost certainly going to wind up limited by the relatively meager 32 gigabytes of on-board storage. I suspect this will drive many, if not most, iPad Pro customers to choose the higher-end storage configuration.\nAdditionally, there\'s clearly a market for iPads with cellular capability, and I\'d imagine the proportion of iPad Pro buyers interested in cellular capability (since it is a more professionally oriented device) is higher than among iPad Air/iPad mini buyers. This could tilt the balance further toward the even higher priced and probably higher margin iPad Pro 128-gigabyte model with cellular capability.\nOne more thing to consider In addition to the fact that iPad Pro may help boost Apple\'s iPad average selling prices enough to stabilize revenue, it\'s important to note that a key part of the iPad Pro experience is the $99 Apple Pencil.\nThe device has generally been praised and seems to be selling quite well. Although a recent report from Kuo suggests the device is simply very tough to manufacture, my guess is the Apple Pencil is still selling quite well relative to the total number of iPad Pros being sold.\nApple almost certainly records Apple Pencil revenue under its "other products" category, which includes "Apple-branded accessories," rather than in its iPad category. Success of the Apple Pencil wouldn\'t directly impact Apple\'s iPad revenue and average selling prices, but I do think Apple will be selling much more accessory content per iPad Pro than it does with other iPads, leading to even higher "effective" iPad average selling prices.\nHow important is iPad to Apple stock? Frankly, although much has been made of the company\'s iPad business, I don\'t see it as all that important to the company\'s share price over the long term. Apple has been and continues to be a company that derives the majority of its revenue and likely an even larger majority of its operating profit from iPhone.\nIt would certainly be nice if iPad could once again be a growth engine for the company (more revenue/profit growth is always welcome), but I don\'t think it\'s going to move the needle for Apple stock either way. As long as Apple can deliver robust iPhone sales growth, Apple stock should do well; should it falter in delivering this growth then, despite what happens with iPad, Apple stock may stagnate or even fall.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying.

S'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter a much anticipated Black Friday season, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) came out on top.\n\nApple Inc.\nDespite not lowering prices for the holiday season, Appledrove a Black Friday success for major retailers. The technology giant did not compromise on its brand or differentiation focus strategy to drive sales for the season, particularly for Black Friday where retailers are known to provide deep discounts for a 1-4 day only time period. However, major retailers such as Target and Best Buy were able to have huge success on this day due to its Apple offerings, despite the lack of discounts for its products. Many retailers offeredincentives and bonuses for full-priced Apple products, such as Target, which offered gift cards with the purchase of an iPad or Apple Watch. As Apples iPhone is its best-selling product, analyst Gene Munsterof Piper Jaffray believes that revenue growth directly depends on the upgrade cycle.\nIn an interview with CNBCs Squak Alley, analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray expressed positive sentiment regarding Apples Black Friday strategy. He commented, If you just look atTargetandBest Buyas two examples, and use them as a barometer, the fact is, theyre really embracing these doorbusters as a sign that demand is pretty healthy here. Additionally, the analysts recent survey indicated narrower gap for iPhone upgrade cycles due to U.S carriers offering a more favorable upgrade plan. He states we believe that the data is an early positive sign that the shift of US carriers to an installment-based smartphone sales model is enabling users to upgrade their devices more frequently. He continues that these more frequent upgrades will yield higher annual iPhone revenues per user, stating We believe the 70% increase in ARPU for iPhone users shifting to annual upgrades driven by the plan is the most important overall financial consideration.\nAccording to TipRanks,which ranks over 7,500 financial analysts and bloggers to gauge the performance of their past recommendations, Gene Munster is ranked #1 out of 3,696 analysts. He has a 70% success rate recommending stocks with an average return of 24.5% per recommendation. Out of the 26 analyst who have rated AAPL in the last 3 months, 27 gave a Buy rating while 9 remain on the sidelines. The average 12-month price target for the stock is $148.77, marking a 26% upside from where shares last closed.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nAmazon had a successful Black Friday as well, with third-party sales up 20% from last year since the start of the season. By shopping online with Amazon, customers were able to avoid the infamous Black Friday crowds, as the NRF reported that 103 million people shopped online as opposed to the 102 million who shopped in stores. This season, company adapted its strategy to make the Black Friday longer than just one day, revealing deals as they come instead of all at once. The company started the season on November 20th and the unveiled 10 coveted deals starting the midnight of Thanksgiving, while revealing 10 more on Black Friday. The company also leveraged its mobile platform by offering exclusive mobile-only deals on its app, extending to December 9th.\nAccording to TipRanksstatistics, out of the 28 analysts who have rated AMZN in the last 3 months, 24 gave a Buy rating while 4 remain on the sidelines. The average 12 month price target for the stock is $715.33, marking a 6% upside from where shares last closed.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. \nAbercrombie drove huge crowds for its Black Friday sale, offering discounts of up to 50% for its Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister divisions. This success came in part due to its overall strategy change, a factor that also drove stellar Q3 earnings for the company. The retailer realized that its target audience for Hollister, teenagers, is flocking towards brands such as H&M and Zara due to their runway trends. Therefore, the company decided to follow suit to stay relevant in the industry by changing some of its styles. The company also decided against general discounting. Furthermore, ANF targeted a broader age group (18-25) who are more fashion-savvy as well as in better financial standing than its teen demographic. The companys Black Friday success represented this shift in design and target market.\nAccording to TipRanks, out of the 10 analysts who have rated ANF in the past 3 months, 2 gave a Buy rating, 1 gave a Sell rating, and 7 remain on the sidelines. The average 12-month price target for the stock is $22.50, marking a 16% downside from where shares last closed.\n\n\nDont be late to the party Click Here to see what 4500 Wall Street Analystssay about your stocks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'

S'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been the subject of a consistent number of leaks and rumors lately. A number of these relate to the iPhone makers dissatisfaction with its current screen tech. It is said the American tech giant wishes to break away from the limitations of the LCD technology that is currently integrated into its latest iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. OLED screens are expected to feature on the iPhone as soon as 2017.\n\nApple wants new screen tech on iPhone\nThe latest iPhone comes with a number of unique visual and touch capabilities, courtesy of Apples powerful A9 chip. Of these qualities, perhaps the most awed is the 3D touch interface. 3D touch allows for varied responses depending on the way in which users touches the screen. The iPhone 6s range also comes with more memory and a larger cam sensor.\nBut the full benefits of the A9 processor are held back by the limits of LCD. Further, LCD would hold back the innovation of future models, too. Switching to OLED would allow for more dynamic visuals, improved reproduction of color, and more power-saving displays with greater viewing angles.\nA major setback, though, would be the lifespan of OLED displays. Though more efficient, OLED screens arent particularly known for their durability. If they are to be placed on a premium handset like the iPhone, Apple would need to find a way around their fragility.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...

S'\n          \n              \n      Summary\n    \n        By jumping into IaaS, Oracle is challenging Amazon Web Services.\n        \n        Oracle doesn\'t appear to have the data center capacity to do so.\n        \n        Oracle\'s late entry may hurt its cash flow and margins.\n        \n    \n  \n\n            \n\n\n              Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), a major player in the database software arena, recently decided to gird up its loins and muscle its way into cloud computing. Oracle calls its venture Elastic Computing because, ostensibly, it will offer efficient infrastructure (IaaS) capable of handling anything an enterprise might want to build or run. Translation: Oracle is throwing down the gauntlet and challenging Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services for supremacy.The problem is that Oracle is late to the party. Microsoft\'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) arrived ahead of Oracle. And Amazon is the acknowledged heavyweight champion in cloud computing. Amazon got to the party early and already dominates Infrastructure-as-a-Cloud. In other words, Oracle\'s late arrival to a very competitive field may prove difficult.Admittedly, Oracle\'s entry is nothing to sneer at. Its cloud revenues for fiscal 2016 (June to May fiscal year) are approaching $2.5 billion. However, Amazon Web Services\' (AWS) revenues for the third-quarter of fiscal 2015 topped $7 billion. Moreover, AWS revenues are increasing 81% year-to-year. AWS\'s expansion rate is hard to ignore and provides evidence of just how far Oracle has to go.If that\'s not demoralizing enough, smaller companies such as Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK) and Tableau (NYSE:DATA) dominate cloud analytics, and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) has targeted the market. All that to say this: The competition is stiff. The only advantage that Oracle has is that companies using its database software may not want to shift horses in the middle of the stream. They may assume that utilizing another cloud provider would exacerbate integration hurdles they are reluctant to take on. Oracle will need to tap into its existing customers and lure them over to its Elastic Computing.Unfortunately, Oracle\'s Elastic Computing products won\'t be accessible until early 2016. This means Oracle is about six months behind all the other players. And there\'s another pregnant question: Does Oracle have the computing facilities necessary to go toe-to-toe with Amazon. Oracle\'s VP, Amit Chaudhry, states that the company has twenty data centers, most of which were built to handle SaaS applications. Building IaaS data facilities would not only require billions of dollars of cash, but negatively affect future margins because of depreciation. Most experts suppose that at the present juncture Oracle\'s IaaS capabilities are minimal, especially compared to those of Amazon and Microsoft\'s Azure.Of course, only a small percentage of enterprises currently use public clouds. In reality, the arena is wide open. And Oracle has to be taken seriously; they are a major player, one that insists on being number one in any endeavor. Still, being late to the IaaS party isn\'t fashionable. In fact, it may be recklessly imprudent in Oracle\'s case. To participate, Oracle is going to have to spend oodles of cash. Even then, the outcome is doubtful. Thus, the short-term and medium-term outlook for Oracle\'s stock is not attractive.\n          \n              (function(){\n                   var disclosureHtmlStr = "<div id=\\\'article_body_top\\\' class=\\\'disclosure_top hidden\\\'><div id=\\\'inner_disclosure\\\'><!--googleoff: index--><strong>Disclosure: <\\/strong>I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. <span onclick=\\\'SA.Modules.Article.Disclosure.expand()\\\' id=\\\'more_button\\\' style=\\\'cursor:pointer\\\'><strong>(More...)<\\/strong><\\/span><span id=\\\'business_disclosure\\\' class=\\\'hidden\\\'>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

S'\n                    A long time ago, graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) had very large ambitions in the market for mobile processors. The company had invested rather heavily in developing applications processors for both the high-end of the mobile device market as well as in trying to build lower-cost chips that integrated both an applications processor and a cellular baseband.\nHowever, as followers of the company are likely aware, the company has largely withdrawn from trying to compete in the market for mobile applications processors.\nThese days, the major market NVIDIA is targeting with its Tegra processor business is automotive applications. For example, Tesla Motors\' (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently launched Model X car uses an NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor to power its infotainment system.\nIn this article I\'d like to provide an update on how the company\'s Tegra processor business is doing.\nHow did it fare last quarter? Over the last nine months? NVIDIA reported that its Tegra processor revenue was $129 million in its most recent quarter, representing a 23% decline from the $168 million that it saw in the year-ago period.\nIn its form 10-Q filing for the quarter, the company said the decline was driven by a more than 80% plunge in sales of Tegra processors into smartphones and tablets. This, the company noted, was offset by a more than 50% surge in chips sold into the automotive market in addition to "increases in revenue from development services and sales of SHIELD devices."\nIf we zoom out and look at the performance of this business over the last nine months, sales are down 14% year over year. The drivers of the revenue decline over that period look very similar to what happened in the most recent quarter; sales of chips into tablets and phones dropped by "almost 90%" while automotive-oriented chip sales grew by "over 75%." SHIELD device revenue and revenue from "development services" also grew.\nIn terms of profitability, the segment lost $65 million last quarter, widening the loss by $12 million from the year-ago period. Over the last nine months, the segment burned through $164 million, with losses actually narrowing slightly from the $169 million seen a year ago.\nHow close is this business to profitability? NVIDIA doesn\'t explicitly break out operating expenses and gross profit margins for this business, but I think a gross profit margin percentage estimate of 35% seems reasonable based on the following chart from the company\'s last financial analyst day:\n\nSource: NVIDIA.\nIf the business lost $164 million on revenues of $402 million then, working under the assumption of gross margins of around 35%, year-to-dateoperating expenses appear to be approximately $305 million. Assuming quarterly operating expenses don\'t vary too much within a given year, then this would imply annualized operating expenses of around $406 million.\nUnder these assumptions (which I caution readers not to place undue reliance on because there is a fair amount of guesswork here), it looks like this segment should hit breakeven at a little under $1.2 billion in revenue. The Tegra processor business would roughly need to double from current levels (assuming current conditions) to just break even if this analysis is correct.\nWhat can NVIDIA do to speed this along? Although the opportunity in in-vehicle infotainment platforms might be large enough to allow NVIDIA to break even/generate profit at the current margin and operating expense run rates, I think the company will need to do two things to speed this along.\nThe first is cost-cutting. NVIDIA recently wound down its Icera modem operations, which should contribute to lower operating costs here for the whole of fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 (the wind-down was scheduled to happen in the second quarter of fiscal 2016).\nI suspect there are probably a number of other things NVIDIA can do to try to cut costs here without compromising its fundamental competitiveness in the automotive infotainment market. For example, I don\'t think NVIDIA needs to continue developing its own custom CPU cores to be viable in this market.\nNext, the path to profitability in this business would be much shorter if the company were to see gross profit margin expansion. A few quarters ago, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said that "the way to increase [NVIDIA\'s] gross margins is to continue to innovate and increase the amount of value-added that we bring."\nHe noted that the company\'s gaming graphics processor business was in the 30% range 10 years ago, but as the company made these platforms "more and more software rich," margins expanded. Huang indicated that he expects the company to do this in the automotive platform business.\nIf the company is successful in growing gross profit margins here, this would certainly bring down the kind of revenue NVIDIA needs to break even in its Tegra processor business.\nStill a ways to go for Tegra There seems to be a lot of investor enthusiasm around Tegra and the opportunity in automotive, but at the end of the day it\'s still the collective stand-alone GPU business that brings in the profits.\nIndeed, the company\'s large and high-margin gaming GPU business continues to grow nicely, which -- in my book -- makes it the most exciting of the company\'s various business units.\nTegra is interesting because it\'s a very fast growing business and I think it\'s easier to sell a "story" around Tegra, particularly since it\'s not too hard to associate it with other "hot" topics like self-driving cars. However, until this business starts pulling its own weight financially, I can\'t help but find the core GPU business more interesting than I do Tegra.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone utilities, stockbrokers, record companies, bookstores, travel agencies, and big box retailers did when the Internet swept away their business models. And when cable falters, you don\'t want to miss out on these 3 companies that are positioned to benefit. Click herefor their names. Hint: They\'re not the ones you\'d think!\n                    \n                '

S'\n          \n              \n      Summary\n    \n        We\'re starting to get additional details on performance specifics for Nvidia\'s upcoming GPU architecture.\n        \n        It seems both Nvidia and AMD will launch their next generation GPUs in the early half of 2016.\n        \n        From what I\'ve seen, both AMD and Nvidia tend to exaggerate performance figures leading up to a major launch.\n        \n        However, Nvidia claims a far more sizable performance improvement than AMD.\n        \n        This leads me to believe that Nvidia will have a performance advantage, but perhaps in line with historical trends of a 10% to 30% gaming FPS advantage when compared to AMD.\n        \n    \n  \n\n            \n\n\n              As many of you have noted, I have become increasingly optimistic on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past couple weeks. For the most part I view this company through the lens of opportunity and also believe that the stock\'s valuation will steadily move higher over the next couple years. Very rarely do I encounter compelling growth opportunities within tech, but I believe this company has strategically positioned itself so that it can continue its growth trajectory.That being the case, Nvidia seems to be laying on the momentum as it\'s rumored that Nvidia\'s next-generation GPU will be launched over the next four- to five-month timeframe. Personally, I\'m waiting with tons of excitement for the upcoming GPU architecture as I\'m going to build a beastly gaming machine upon its launch.(click to enlarge)Source: NvidiaThe key takeaway for the upcoming Pascal architecture is the massive improvement to both memory speed and size. This becomes important because current generation GPUs aren\'t equipped to handle 4K resolutions as they easily exceed the 4GB of allotted memory for mid to high-end enthusiast cards. Furthermore, there aren\'t that many GPUs that can play 4K with reliable frame rates. It\'s expected that more game titles will be released using Direct X12 with much higher graphics intensity. This all leads to a major GPU refresh cycle, which will be driven by want as opposed to need. The number of PC gamers has increased quite significantly over the years, and channel checking does indicate that PCs should bottom out in the 2016 timeframe. Given all of these favorable dynamics, the upcoming Pascal architecture will arrive right when Nvidia needs it most.While we don\'t know much in terms of pricing, we can get a basic idea on the performance improvement when looking at transistor density, memory speed and available memory. The node shrink also implies higher clock speeds so there should be a significant difference in performance when compared to Maxwell architecture.At least according to MyGaming:Making use of TSMC\'s (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company)16nm FinFET process, and the 3D transistors it allows for as a result, Pascal GPUs allegedly feature as many as 17 billion transistors - for reference sake, that\'s more than the transistors of the combined transistor count of Nvidia\'s GeForce GTX Titan X (GM200) and AMD\'s Radeon R9 Fury X (Fiji XT), 8 billion and 8.9 billion transistors respectively.Assuming Nvidia can double its transistor and increase memory to 16GB of 2nd generation high bandwidth memory, Pascal architecture GPUs should handle 4K a lot better. In that case, consumers will likely move further up the stack so they can leverage 4K in more of their gaming. While, there\'s not much content support for 4K in movies and television, almost every PC title can run 4K. Therefore, the ability to immediately experience 4K gameplay is the main reason for offering so much memory at the high-end SKUs, as higher resolutions often get bottlenecked due to lack of video memory.While Nvidia\'s upcoming Pascal will be confronted with competition from its bitter rival AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), there aren\'t that many details on the performance improvements of AMD\'s upcoming GPU architecture. However, it seems that AMD could have a bit of a density advantage due to its fab relationship with Globalfoundries as opposed to Nvidia which has opted for TSM\'s 16nm FF+. The problem though for AMD has been Nvidia\'s consistent track record with improving its core GPU architecture, which seems to overcompensate in enough ways to allow Nvidia to continue to market a performance advantage at pricing tiers above $300. In a sense, this puts AMD in a tough position with its upcoming high-end SKUs codenamed Greenland because it seems improbable that AMD will create better-performing parts.At AMD\'s Q3 2015 earnings conference call Lisa Su provides some color on performance for the upcoming Arctic Islands GPU family:We are also focused on delivering our next generation GPUs in 2016 designed to improve performance per watt by 2x compared to our current offerings based on design architectural enhancements as well as advanced FinFET products process technology.For the most part, it seems AMD\'s promise of 2x performance per watt seems far less exaggerated than Nvidia\'s claim of improving performance by 10x. Of course, 10x performance is more or less synonymous with a 10x improvement on a per watt basis by virtue of the fact that GPUs can\'t increase power consumption given heat constraints and form factor issues. That being the case, if Nvidia is able to deliver a 4x performance improvement in real world gaming it will pull ahead of AMD. However, I can\'t imagine such a huge difference in performance between Nvidia and AMD. It\'s more likely that it will be reflected in terms of a 10% to 30% performance advantage in terms of gaming benchmarks that use frames per second as the reference measure. That being the case, Nvidia will likely edge out AMD, but not to the extent Nvidia\'s preliminary performance data suggests. Usually, the PR guys at AMD and Nvidia generate tons of hype leading up to a major GPU refresh. As such, I still believe Nvidia will come ahead in terms of performance, but it will likely be marginal as we\'ve seen in years past.(click to enlarge)Source: AmigobullsBoth AMD and Nvidia have done pretty well in the past two months. Just because the two companies compete with each other, it\'s not necessarily a zero sum game. The entire gaming PC market is growing at a relatively fast pace, which indicates that the tide is lifting the boats of both companies. While I do view Nvidia as a better long-term growth investment, AMD also presents a compelling deep value case as well.Over the next couple months, I will be eagerly watching for more developments when pertaining to Nvidia\'s and AMD\'s upcoming GPU architecture. I view Nvidia as a high-conviction buy and I reiterate my $42.65 price target.\n          \n              (function(){\n                   var disclosureHtmlStr = "<div id=\\\'article_body_top\\\' class=\\\'disclosure_top hidden\\\'><div id=\\\'inner_disclosure\\\'><!--googleoff: index--><strong>Disclosure: <\\/strong>I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. <span onclick=\\\'SA.Modules.Article.Disclosure.expand()\\\' id=\\\'more_button\\\' style=\\\'cursor:pointer\\\'><strong>(More...)<\\/strong><\\/span><span id=\\\'business_disclosure\\\' class=\\\'hidden\\\'>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

NVIDIA Corporation has a market cap of 16887.82 and its gross margin is 56.00%.\nDividend\nNVIDIA Corporation has a dividend yield of 1.47%. Dividend yield is a ratio that indicates how much a company pays out in dividends, relative to its share price. A high dividend yield ratio is considered anything over 5%, while a very high ratio is considered anything over 10%. This ratio is most commonly expressed as a percentage. The dividend yield essentially measures the amount of money an investor is getting from his or her equity position. Typically a safe bet, high dividend stocks are used by more conservative investors who need a lower cash flow.\nVolume\nHere are the statistics on NVIDIA Corporations 52-week performance currently. It has a 52 week low of 68.48%, a 52 week high of -1.35%, and a simple moving average of 14.51% over the last 50 days. Its volume is 2174900 with an average volume of 8629.13. Volume is the number of shares traded in either a stock, or an exchange during a set period of time. High activity stocks may mean that something is going on in the company, and are therefore watched more closely by investors. Volume is most simply put, the amount of shares that trade hands.\nPrice to Earnings\nNVIDIA Corporation has a forward P/E of 23.22 and a P/E of 29.34. The P/E of a company is commonly used when comparing current earnings to forecasted future earnings. For example, if a company forecasts future profitability, the estimated P/E will be lower than the current P/E. P/E is calculated by dividing the market price per share by the expected earnings per share, and also referred to as price-to-earnings.

S'\n                    There was a lot to like when Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its fiscal 2016 Q1 earnings on Oct. 22, and based on its 12% share price pop since delivering the good news, investors agreed. Cloud revenue continues to soar, the adoption of Office 365 is skyrocketing, and even long-suffering units like Microsoft\'s Bing search have turned the corner.\nWith over 110 million downloads it became available to the masses in late July, it\'s safe to say Microsoft\'s latest operating system (OS), Windows 10, has also been a success. And should a recent study from Gartner bear out, the record-breaking adoption of Windows 10 could prove to be a game-changer, boosting results across multiple divisions.\nSurvey says Gartner says that in just two short years "Windows 10 is poised to become the most widely installed version of Windows ever," with a whopping 50% of enterprises either utilizing the new OS or beginning the process of adopting it by 2017.\nGartner points to Windows 10 being a free upgrade and its compatibility with earlier versions of Microsoft\'s OS as two reasons it will be an unmitigated success. That, combined with a "pent up demand for tablet and 2-in-1 device rollouts" in the workplace, is expected to drive Windows 10 deployments. In fact, Gartner suggests that the pace of the Windows 10 rollout will help fuel a transition to a "new employee workspace that is more mobile."\nIt\'s back Not only did Microsoft\'s Bing search engine unit report an impressive 29% jump in revenue last quarter, it actually turned a profit -- and ahead of Nadella\'s schedule, no less. What was the impetus for the Bing turnaround? Windows 10, and that\'s with a "mere" 110 million downloads. Assuming 50% of enterprises upgrade to the new OS by 2017, Bing\'s growth to 20.8% share of the U.S. search market could prove to be just the tip of the iceberg.\nOf course, with a market share of just shy of 64%, supplanting Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the king of search isn\'t likely any time soon. Thanks in part to its renewed focus on mobile search, Alphabet\'s 35% year-over-year increase in paid clicks last quarter make it pretty clear who the king of the search hill is. But Microsoft doesn\'t need to unseat the formerly named Google for Bing to be a success: continuing to eke out gains and profits thanks to Windows 10 will work just fine.\nMobile-first Microsoft, like Alphabet, has heard some grumbling from investors due to seemingly poor mobile results. Thing is, Nadella\'s mobile-first initiative entails a lot more than selling smartphones, which is why Microsoft\'s mobile ambitions could get a big boost from the adoption of Windows 10. Gartner\'s expectations for a more mobile workforce as Windows 10 becomes the preeminent enterprise OS could boost sales of Microsoft\'s Surface Pro pseudo-tablet line-up.\nAs businesses become more mobile, it stands to reason many would outfit their employees with devices that match their enterprise OS, half of which will be running Windows 10 in a couple of years according to Gartner. Microsoft\'s Surface Pro line-up, pre-loaded with enterprise-compatible Windows 10, would seem to be a natural.\nCloud-first Let\'s not forget where Microsoft butters its bread: the cloud. And commercial Windows 10 adoption should also provide a boost to the company\'s cloud results. As enterprises shift away from legacy data storage and analytics solutions to cloud-based services, many of the 50% of enterprises utilizing Windows 10 are likely to opt for OS compatible cloud solutions like Microsoft\'s Azure platform and its associated Software-as-a-Service suite of products.\nAt an annual run-rate of over $8.2 billion, Microsoft is already at or near the top of the list of cloud providers, and Windows 10 should add fuel to the fire. As more enterprises shift data to the cloud from in-house systems, opting for a solution from the same provider that developed the enterprise\'s operating system -- aka Microsoft\'s Windows 10 -- is yet another "natural."\nMicrosoft became the leading software provider in the world thanks to its OS dominance, and Windows 10 could prove to be just as important as Nadella and team continue the company\'s emergence as a mobile and cloud leader.\n\nWarren Buffett: This new technology is a "real threat"At the recent Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Warren Buffett admittedthis emerging technology is threatening his biggest cash-cow. Buffett\'s fear can be your gain.Only a fewinvestors are embracing this new market, which experts saywill be worth over $2 trillion.

In addition, the National Association of Realtors reported that pending home sales were up 0.2%, but Wall Street was expecting a 1% increase.\nThe S&P 500 led the declines with a 0.5% drop, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaqgave back 0.4%. Still, a few stocks pushed back against the weakness. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) andFitbit Inc (NYSE:FIT) were the darlings of some analysts comments, while Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE:BHI) was enjoying more love from last weeks bullishness.\nHeres a closer look at each of these hot stocks from Monday:\nMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT)\nMSFT stock was up roughly 2% for most of the day before tapering off after receiving an analyst upgrade and announcing some new features from its Office 365 service.\n5 Big Pharma Stocks to Buy (And 2 Busts to Avoid!)\nRaymond James analysts upgraded Microsoft shares from market perform to strong buy, with a $72 price target on MSFT stock. That would be a roughly 30% jump from current prices above $54.\nWith a price tag of $35 a month, Microsofts business edition of Office 365 will now offer unlimited conferencing, Skype for Business and other features. It was four years ago that MSFT bought Skype for $8.5 billion.\nFitbit Inc (FIT)\nFIT was another winner today after reports that sales on wearable fitness trackers was brisk over the holiday weekend. Target said the Fitbit Charge HR was one of its best-selling gift items. Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) said sales of the FIT wearables were about two times what they werea year ago.\nAdding to the bullish tone were a couple of analysts notes. For one, Credit Suisse says Fitbit has 116% upside. Meanwhile, Barclays analyst Matthew McClintock, who upgraded FIT stock from equal weight to overweight, adding that there was no justification for FIT stocks recent decline.\nFIT stock rose 3% on the day.\nBaker Hughes Incorporated (BHI)\nAlthough there was no fresh news on BHI stock today, the oil rigger was up more than 2% as a carry-over trade from just before the holiday weekend. On Wednesday of last week, Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) announced it will do whatever is necessary for antitrust authorities to approve its $34.6 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes, including the disposal of $7.5 billion worth of additional assets that regulators will require.\nHedge fund ValueAct Capital Partners, L.P. penned a letter to clients saying that after discussions with both HAL and BHI, it feels certain that the deal is still on track and will close on time.\nBHI stock, which has been languishing lately, closed above its 50-day moving average again today for the first time in a month.\nAs of this writing, Ethan Roberts did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\nMore From InvestorPlace\nFitbit Stock Has Massive 116% Upside (FIT)\n5 Reasons Why Amazon Stock Is a Buy  Even at All-Time Highs\n3 Restaurant Stocks to Buy for 2016\n\n\t\n\n\t\n"

Analyst Michael Turits put a price target of $62 on the firms stock and said that its cloud business has a massive opportunity to scale in the coming months and years. The firm raisedits rating from Market Perform to Strong Buy.\n\nMr. Turits called Azure, the firms cloud business, oneof the hyperscale elite products that was out there today. In his view Microsoft is one of the few tech companies with the scale and product scope to become a truly hybrid vendor. He said the firm will match its services, infrastructure, platform and software to create a truly compelling product range.\nMicrosoft gets a ramp from the cloud\nThe analysts that authored the report said we view Azure as among the select few hyperscale and therefore low-cost competitors to Amazon Web Services and Google.  Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) is currently the leader in the cloud business, but theres going to plenty of that business to go around in the coming years according to Raymond James.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nAlphabetInc has yet to jump into the cloud world in earnest, but the firm is ramping up its efforts.

While Windows remains vulnerable to PC trends absent mobile traction, Turits wrote, we estimate the most exposed portion, consumer Windows, at less than 5% of revenue this year.\nWindows is one of the big weaknesses that those on Wall Street no fond of Redmond tend to point to. Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs says Windows 10 is likely to get in the way of growth at the firm. WalterPritchard of Citibank agrees with that premise. Almost all of Wall Street sees the cloud and service business as the way forward for Microsoft.\nShares in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) opened on Monday morning at $54.54, which means the Raymond James price target is looking at a 13 percent upside in the next twelve months on the back of growth in the firms cloud business.

S'\n            \n                \n                    \n\n                        Microsoft Corporation has come up with a technological update in alliance with the British charity Guide Dogs for visually impaired people. It comes up with a headphone and an app that allows them to navigate through their surroundings.\nThe update features two new experiences that enable users to get extra knowledge about their surrounding, either by issuing voice commands or by giving instructions via a remote. Also, the app aids wearers in navigation through sound prompts and directional audio to help create a mental picture of their environment.\nMicrosoft released its first prototype last year that featured clicking sounds to navigate users. According to Microsoft, the new technology has been redesigned and will have more utility for users.\nMicrosoft added that the new update provides more independence and confidence to its users by assistance with guide dogs. The physical remote along with the headset permits users with a guide dog or a cane to keep their hands free. The remote consists of three buttons, each associated with specific functions such as navigating a user, repeating a command, or providing knowledge about surroundings.\nThe latest feature addition to this software is termed as 3D audio by Microsoft, as it creates a mind map about one\'s surroundings on the basis of sound that a user hears. Microsoft further said that the software guides a user through sound and works as a demonstrator that paints the surrounding picture in the same way as "a light guides the lighthouse." It works by spatially locating the synthetic sounds around a user, thus, creating a 3D soundscape.\nThe new update also contains Look Ahead and Orientate feature that helps users learn about their surroundings. In addition, it provides information based on distance. Also, the improvement in audio navigation ensures that a user is on the right direction.\nThe technology was tested around town with people who had blindfolds on. The evaluation test has been a success for users, as they found it extremely supportive for the visually impaired people.\nFurthermore, Microsoft also developed CityScribe, an integrated application that allows people to tag hindrances (hurdles that people face daily) in their city, which most of the mapping sites fail to pick. These include low jutting corners, park benches, street furniture, or bins. Microsofts drive to help visually impaired people navigate safely on a daily basis has received a boost with the update and its results.                    \n\n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        '

S'\n                    The reaction was muted when Alphabet\'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube unveiled its Red paid service. But the company\'s recent meetings with Hollywood royalty regarding content are turning some heads.\nThe company plans to create 10 original YouTube Red movies, the first to be released on the service in 2016. Alphabet is also looking at producing TV series, much in the vein of competitors Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime, Hulu, and Time Warner\'s HBO.\nIn this video clip, The Motley Fool\'s Chris Hill and David Kretzmann explain where the company\'s recent moves might lead and the advantages YouTube has over its competition in the video-on-demand space.\nA full transcript follows the video.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone utilities, stockbrokers, record companies, bookstores, travel agencies, and big box retailers did when the Internet swept away their business models. And when cable falters, you don\'t want to miss out on these 3 companies that are positioned to benefit. Click herefor their names. Hint: They\'re not the ones you\'d think!\n\nThis podcast was recorded on 12/3/2015.\nChris Hill: Let\'s start with the interesting newsabout the latest in the battlefor the living room. ExecutivesfromYouTubeare reportedly meeting withexecutives in Hollywoodto discuss licenses fornew video content, new movies, new television.   YouTube, I don\'t want to say they quietly rolled out Red,which is their premium video service, but it wasn\'t loud. It wasn\'t a big, splashy rollout. And I thinkthey\'re looking at providing more value for anyone who wants to pay $10 a month for what, at the moment,is just a promise that we\'re not going to serve up any ads. If you\'reNetflix, if you\'reAmazon Prime, if you\'reHulu, how nervous are you right now?  David Kretzmann: Iwouldn\'t be too nervous at this point, but it\'s definitely something to watch because when you have even other players likeHBOGoand different things ascable TV is increasinglyunbundled,and you have more online streaming options,the competitive landscape is definitelyintensifying.   ButI think YouTube mightrecognize that they need to boost the value propositionif they\'re going to get peopleto move from consuming YouTube for free, or just watching ads -- that\'s the only price you have to pay at this point to use YouTube. But they needto boost that value proposition if people are going to pay $10 a month, which is what they could pay for Hulu or Netflix or other services like that. So,you know, they\'re looking at releasing 10original movies and TV showsusing their YouTube stars, their home-grown content. They\'ll start releasing those in 2016.  Now,they\'re looking into licensing TV showsand other movies, which is whatNetflix and Hulu and Amazonand all those other players are doing. So,it\'ll be interesting to see. YouTubedoes have the advantage throughGoogle, which has their Google Play store. Google already has some relationships with those studioslicensing movies and TV shows. So, YouTube does have that advantage here as they get started.  Hill: We talk from time to time about Larry Page and Sergey Brinand the incredible company they\'ve built with,I guess we now have to call itAlphabet. But part ofwhat they\'ve done is assemblea pretty phenomenal team of leaderswithin their universe, and one of them is Susan Wojcicki,who heads up YouTube. AndI read a profile of her a couple of months ago,and what was striking to me wasnot just how talentedand what a great leader she appears to be. Sheappears to be very much the personfor this job.  But also,what an opportunity that YouTube represents for Alphabet because they haven\'t reallycracked the code yet. And maybe this is it. Maybethis is the move where they\'ve looked at the landscapeand said, "You know what? Netflix is onto something. We\'ve got deep pockets. We can buy content." Little tougher, though,if you\'re looking to create your own original content.  Kretzmann: Yeah. It\'llbe interesting for YouTube in this transition.I sort of picture YouTube as a placewhere if you\'re thinking of a video,that\'s where you go to search. So,they could really personalize this and benefit that way.   If they can bring TV showsand movies, and take advantage of the things people are searching for. Because I think, more so thanAmazon or Netflix,at least for me,if there\'s something that\'s just a quick searchof a movie or show or anything else,I\'m going to YouTube. So,they\'re definitely attracting a lot of people. Theyhave a very engaged and active audience. So,there\'s definitely potential here.   Whether or not Redis the answer, we\'ll see. But I thinkit definitely makes sensethat they need to bolster thecontent that they have. So, this move is understandable.  Hill: You\'ve gotta be prettyhappy if you\'re a TV studio or a movie studio,the idea that YouTube could come knockingon your door and say, "Well, we\'vegot an entire bag full of money,let\'s talk about what you have in your content library."  Kretzmann: Yeah, life is good. It\'s the holidays.\n                    \n                '

(NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, in an interview to BuzzFeed, said the firm aims to develop meaningful and powerful products for the students and teachers, and not inexpensive test machines like Chromebook from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG). Cook was referring to the recent reports that Chromebooks dominate the lucrative education market.\n\nApple loses education market to Google\nWe are interested in helping students learn and teachers teach, but tests, no, Cook said. We create products that are whole solutions for people  that allow kids to learn how to create and engage on a different level.\nAt one point in time, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) claimed a commanding share of the education market, which it ceded to Google now with the shift to an assessment-driven curriculum in American classrooms. Schools across the nation are now questioning whether they really need to purchase a Mac or iPad when a low-cost computer suffices all their needs.\nThe shift in priorities and the budgetary concerns are a big factor for the switch from iOS to Chromebooks. Also, keyboards are required in mandated tests and, for this reason, buying an iPad or other tablet device is not a viable option for some districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nHowever, Cook is firm on Apples direction. The iPhone firm has decades of experience in serving educational institutions, and the current solutions it offers are highly effective and finely-tuned classroom tools.

The earnings per share growth over the next five years will be . Adobe Systems Incorporated had an earnings per share growth of -6.20% in the last 5 years.\nCurrently the return on equity is 7.40% and its debt to equity is 0.28. Adobe Systems Incorporated has a total market cap of $ 44672.53, a gross margin of 84.60% while the profit margin is 10.80% and the ROI is 3.90% \n\nPerformance\nThe stats on Adobe Systems Incorporated are currently as follows.\nThe weekly performance is -2.67%, and the quarterly performance is at 13.80%. The monthly performance is -0.27% and the yearly performance is 25.14%. The performance for Year to Date (YTD) is 23.19%.\nAdobe Systems Incorporated has earnings per share of $ 0.98 and the earnings per share growth for this year is -5.40%. The ROI is 3.90% and the return on equity for Adobe Systems Incorporatedas stated earlier, is currently at 7.40%.The return on assets (ROA) for Adobe Systems Incorporated is 4.50%. \nThe earnings per share (EPS) is a direct measure of a companys profit. EPS is calculated by subtracting dividends from profits and dividing it by the total number of shares outstanding.\nThe return on investment (ROI) is the money a company has made or lost on an investment  in simple terms. \nThe return on equity (ROE) measures the companys profitability and the efficiency at which it is generating those profits. ROE is calculated by dividing the total profit by total amount of money invested in the company. \nThe return on assets (ROA) is a very useful indicator that illustrates how profitable a company really is in relation to its total assets. ROA is calculated by dividing the total annual earnings by the companys total assets.\n\nDividends and Price Earnings Ratio\nAdobe Systems Incorporated has a dividend yield of *TBA. The price/earnings ratio (P/E) is 91.39 and the forward P/E ratio stands at 32.05. The price to earnings growth is 2.79 and the price to sales growth is 9.79. \nThe price/earnings ratio (P/E) is one of the best known investment valuation indicators. P/E is calculated by dividing the trailing 12 months earnings per share by the present share price. Typically, a high P/E ratio means that the investors are paying more for todays earnings in hopes of future growth in earnings. \nThe forward price to earnings ratio, as the name suggests, is used to find the future price to earnings ratio. It is calculated by dividing the market price per share with the anticipated earnings per share.\nThe price to earnings growth ratio (PEG) is utilized for determining a stocks value in relation to the companys earnings. It helps to provide a more holistic picture with the P/E ratio. The PEG is calculated by dividing the price to earnings ratio by the annual earnings per share growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock is undervalued in relation to its earnings performance. \nVolume\nAdobe Systems Incorporated has a 52-week low of 29.83% and 52-week high of -3.57%. The company has a 20-day simple moving average of 1.30% and a volume of 1.30%. The average volume stands around 3343.55.\nVolume is the amount of shares that trade hands  in simple terms. \nTechnical\nThe technical stats for Adobe Systems Incorporated are as follows.\nAdobe Systems Incorporated has a simple moving average of 1.30% over the last 20 days. The simple moving average for the last 200 days stands at 10.00%. Adobe Systems Incorporated has a beta of 1.34 and the weekly and monthly volatility stands at 3.43% and 1.99% respectively. \nA simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of the stock for the given time periods, say for 20 days, and then dividing it by that time period- i.e 20. It usually helps to smooth out the noise by filtering out random price movements. Since SMA is based on past data, it will tend to have a lag. The longer the time period the greater the lag. So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. \nBeta is used to measure the volatility of the stock. A beta of less than 1 means that it is less volatile than the market and a beta of greater than 1 means that it is more volatile than the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock will move with the market.\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\nVolatility, in simple terms, is an indicator of how risky the stock is. It is the amount of uncertainty or riskabout the magnitude of changes in a stocks value. Higher volatility means that a stocks price can change radically in either direction in a very short period of time and lower volatility is just the opposite, as the price doesnt change dramatically  instead it varies at a steady pace over a significantly longer period of time. \n\n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and information expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any company stakeholders, financial professionals, or analysts.

S'\n          \n              \n      Summary\n    \n        Lots of rumors refer to an Intel powered Surface Phone, in 2016.\n        \n        Microsoft is working on a Continuum feature compatible with x86 applications.\n        \n        Latest rumor source, near Microsoft, states that the old project for Spring 2016 is canceled, while Panas took the new project for Fall 2016.\n        \n        Intel will release the x3 LTE mid-end solutions and high-end Goldmont cores in mid 2016, in perfect time for the eventual Surface Phone.\n        \n        Microsoft is widening its market while Intel has a high growth potential and the chance to get better PC sales. Microsoft and Intel are a buy.\n        \n    \n  \n\n            \n\n\n              Rumors about Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) working on a Surface Phone have been quite pressing lately. In July, there was a specific rumor stating that a Surface Phone was coming in Spring 2016. While the news was "great," the time frame looked quite strange due to a series of issues concerning Intel Corporation (INTC), the team working on it and so on.Some days ago, the same source stated that things have quite changed, providing something that would be far more coherent to the actual Surface line and the future hardware availability. I would say that a Surface Phone will come for sure, but let\'s start step by step.Above concept by Nadir AslamJuly rumorIn July, Daniel Rubino, from Windows Central, wrote that its source could affirm that the Redmond company was working on a Surface Phone to be released in May 2016. That rumor was quite fascinating, but it has various project issues:the only partner suitable to power that phone is Intel, but new mid-market SoFIA solutions and high-end Goldmont cores will come only in mid 2016Microsoft is expected to release its new Surface 5 Pro, Surface Book 2 and next flagship Lumias in Fall 2016, not beforeWindows 10 Redstone is expected to be released in Summer 2016, not beforeIn fact, it came out that the project was an old one from the Nokia route and it had different projected time frames.Design and project coherencyIn October, Panos Panay said that "That\'s a question I get asked a lot," in response to an interview question about the Surface Phone. After that, he also said "Over time you want a consistent thread between the products, especially the hardware as well. I think what you have to think with overall devices is making sure we are able to get that consistent premium fit and finish that people are expecting from Microsoft." In Panay\'s opinion, that fit and finish involve "consistency across design" and "consistency across craftsmanship".This is not a clear and loud statement that a Surface Phone will happen, but it is very likely that they are working on some kind of Surface-inspired Lumia or directly a Surface Phone version.Another hint comes from an article where various new phone prototypes and Surface Minis have been discovered during a visit at Building-87.x86 Continuum and Continuum-ContinuityA tweet about Kevin Gallo (VP, Windows Developer Platform) reports that Microsoft is working on implementing Win32 app compatibility in Continuum mode. Pay attention to "working on." Nothing is sure, but they are surveying if such a feature would be sensible (yes) and if it is technically feasible. We must remember that such a feature would require x86 hardware, implying the obvious Intel presence.Additionally, with Windows 10 Redstone slated for next summer, Windows will implement Continuity-like features, where universal apps and Microsoft features will be synchronized in real-time between smartphones and PCs, making possible chats and phone calls directly between smartphones and PCs.Core M tested in phabletsIn a previous article, I have written about the chance to see a Surface Phone powered by a clocked down Core M or its derivatives. That idea was driven by Intel, which is testing Core M with phablets for unspecified objectives. It is clear that these kinds of tests are keen to the idea of providing the right hardware in order to power a smartphone-PC in the near future. Testing a Core M is probably a way to survey how much the 4.5 TDP is excessive for such a device, and if the Skylake architecture is suitable to drive a smartphone or if it needs some tweaks or heavy mods.HTML5 leaked testSome days ago, a leaked test was reported, showing a "Surface Phone" benchmarked with HTML5. It was outdated, with outdated specs and outdated Windows and Edge versions. Therefore, it could be both a false rumor or some kind of test product, maybe belonging to the previous Lumia route. In any case, it is probably another sign that something is in store from Microsoft.Fall 2016 rumorThe last rumor is still reported by Daniel Rubino, from Windows Central. It came out that Microsoft decided to shut down the prior project from the Lumia route, in order to start a new project with Panos Panay, the creator of the new Surface line - a decision consistent with the design and craftsmanship coherency.It is also known that this project is developed jointly with Intel and it is likely to follow the "consistency across design" and "consistency across craftsmanship" in relation to the Surface line. This project is slated for Fall 2016, meeting the Redstone and new Atom release, not forgetting that Fall 2016 is the time window for the next Surface and high-end Lumia update.The potential of a Surface PhoneAnyway, the most important topic is whether such a device would have a market. My personal opinion is yes, of course.Even if we consider the x86 Continuum feature alone, it would add a feature, which is not achievable by competitors. Such a smartphone would reach a productivity level unrivaled once connected to an external monitor, by wireless or cables. For easy tasks and certain needs, it would be able to substitute PCs that are over rated for the majority of common usage, with the added value of having a pocket PC inside the trouser pocket. For other users, it would be simply an additional feature that would make it preferable to competitors\' smartphones, without touching their own PC needs.But, if we also consider the entire ecosystem, what Continuum is now and what it will be, what will come with the Redstone update and the chance to use traditional apps for not demanding tasks (which is the need of the majority of common users), we see that Microsoft is probably finding the right route to heavily enter the smartphone market, directly from the high-end, exploiting a specific and interesting function.There is still the problem of app availability and quality, still far from the iOS or Android platform. Unfortunately, the fourth bridge, Project Astoria, got paused due to various management concerns; therefore, Android apps will not be supported to run on Windows 10 at least for a while.There are still three bridges in order to raise the number and quality of Windows mobile apps:Project Centennial, in order to convert Win32 and .NET apps to Universal Applications (potential of 16 million apps),Project Islandwood, in order to port iOS apps to Windows. It needs more code effort compared to Project Astoria,Project Westminster, in order to reduce a website into a web app.These projects will surely push on the worst aspect of Windows Mobile, which is its app store. In any case, Windows 10 may be able to overcome the lack of sufficient traditional mobile apps through unique bridge apps that connect the mobile environment to the traditional desktop applications. The chance to use traditional desktop applications, with a mobile counterpart that exploits a full "continuum" between the mobile and desktop apps, could be something very disruptive, given the actual Windows installed base. At the moment, more than 150 million PCs run Windows 10 and, while the upgrading is slowing slightly, it is expected to see a spike during holiday sales and later.The takeawayGiven first positive reviews about Lumia 950 and 950 XL, a Surface Phone and/or x86 Continuum would be a very good and interesting innovation in the mobile scenario.Microsoft is likely to release the Surface Phone as a high-end premium device, with a metal magnesium chassis and the most powerful new Atom SoCs. I would not exclude the release of a mid-end smartphone, with a plastic chassis and a SoFIA x3 mid-end solution, in order to widen the market penetration.The potential of such kind of a device is very high and it is likely to see tens of millions of devices sold in the first months, providing good revenues for Microsoft\'s mobile sector. If we account for an ASP of $650, production, testing and transporting cost about $225 per device and something around 10 million devices sold, we can see a gross profit around $4 billion and revenues around $6.5 billion. But, given the peculiarity of this device and its ability to partially substitute traditional PC or Tablets devices, an higher ASP could really be expected already from the first year.We must not forget that Windows can be adopted by other OEMs, being Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Motorola (NYSE:MSI), Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), Huawei, LG, Asus (OTC:ASUUY) or others. Once Continuum will adopt x86 functionality and traditional desktop applications will be able to run on x86 smartphones, it is to be expected an OEM run to implement Windows on various smartphone solutions. This is the other part of Microsoft\'s strategy, keen to generate revenues from Windows related services. With a market of 1.5 billion smartphones shipped per year, this is a very big revenue source to attack and exploit.I personally rate Microsoft and Intel with a buy rating. Microsoft is going to expand and grow its own business, modifying its business strategies and attacking emerging markets. If it will release a Surface Phone or x86 Continuum, things will get very interesting. For what concerns Intel, I have already explained my recent market and technology view (1-2), also in relation to a potential Surface Phone. Accounting also for network virtualization and cloud growth, Intel is poised to considerably grow in the next years. Additionally, there is a growing feeling that PC sales are going to get better:late Skylake market entry,strong demand for Skylake processors,second Skylake FAB ramping in Ireland,high gaming GPU card sales,consistent OEM offer for 2-in-1 devices,too high quantity of >4 years old PC/laptops,Gartner analysis states that PC sales will get better starting from 4Q 2015,Indian and US laptop sales are already positive from 2Q,Gartner talks about stability for 2H 2016 and growth for the following years, driven by PC updates.These driving factors are more than a mere sign that things are going to get better, and it is clear that Intel\'s actual stock price is "hold" only by PC sales concern. Eventual up-revisions or IDC/Gartner positive updates would trigger a stock price spike.\n          \n              (function(){\n                   var disclosureHtmlStr = "<div id=\\\'article_body_top\\\' class=\\\'disclosure_top hidden\\\'><div id=\\\'inner_disclosure\\\'><!--googleoff: index--><strong>Disclosure: <\\/strong>I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. <span onclick=\\\'SA.Modules.Article.Disclosure.expand()\\\' id=\\\'more_button\\\' style=\\\'cursor:pointer\\\'><strong>(More...)<\\/strong><\\/span><span id=\\\'business_disclosure\\\' class=\\\'hidden\\\'>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

S'\n    Intel shares have not done well over the past two quarters, mainly due to the companysover-dependence on the declining PC market. Despite that, the chip maker was able to cheer investors with positive news on itsannual Analyst Day. Now Nomura has upgraded the chip maker, citing improved Data Center spending.\n\nDCG to bring more revenues\nNomura analyst Romit Shah raised Intel from Neutral to Buy, saying that the companys Data Center business alone is valued at $31 to $34 per share. This suggests that Intels other businesses  the Internet Of Things (IoT) and Client Computing  are available at a great discount. The chip maker is presently trading at around $35.\nThis suggests that at the current market valuation, investors get what we think could be seen as almost a free call option on the client computing, Internet of Things and memory businesses, Shah wrote.\nThe analystexpects Intels DCG segment to post robust growth in 2016 owing to improved data center spending and continued strength in the cloud. The cloud segment now accounts for 33% of Intels data center business, up from 20% in 2013. Shah believes that increased revenues from the data center group could push Intels margins up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\n\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  #admobil {\n      display:none;\n }\n  #adpost {\n      display:inline-block;\n      width:290px !important;\n      height:235px;\n }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 600px) {\n  #admobil {\n      display:none;\n }\n  #adpost {\n      display:inline-block;\n      width:336px;\n      height:280px;\n }\n}\n\n\n\nAll big tech firms, including Microsoft, Apple and Google parent Alphabet, are expected to increase their investments in data centers. From 6% in 2015, industry-wide internet capex is expected to rise to 18% in 2016, Shah believes.\nIntels CY16 EPS estimate has been raised to $2.51 from $2.30, considering strong revenue growth in DCG, benefits from the acquisition of Altera and an extra week of revenues. Nomura also raised Intels 12-month target price from $33 to $42.\nIntel a survivor\nEven though the company missed third-quarter revenueestimatessignificantly, pushed out 10 million units in the second quarter and lowered its DCG guidance in the fourth quarter, still, its shares are down by less than 10% year to date. This indicates that the chip maker is a survivor, Shah said.\nPreviously, the chip maker revealed its intention to focus on itsmemory chip-making business with Micron Technology. Also Intel acquired Altera a  programmable chipmaker  to further diversify its offerings. On its Analyst Day, the chip maker raised itsquarterly cash dividends and its outlook for 2016.\nOn Wednesday, Intel shares closed up 0.17% at $34.81. Year to date, the stock is down by over 4%, while in the last one month, it is up by over 4%.\nLike our Facebook page for breaking news updates and leaks.\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n                                \n\n\n        \n\n        \n            Tags: INTC stock intel Cloud PC DCG\n            '

Intel Corporation had an earnings per share growth of 24.60% in the last 5 years.\nCurrently the return on equity is 20.30% and its debt to equity is 0.37. Intel Corporation has a total market cap of $ 164268.4, a gross margin of 62.90% while the profit margin is 20.80% and the ROI is 16.00% \n\nPerformance\nThe stats on Intel Corporation are currently as follows.\nThe weekly performance is -0.06%, and the quarterly performance is at 19.76%. The monthly performance is 4.38% and the yearly performance is -2.80%. The performance for Year to Date (YTD) is -1.19%.\nIntel Corporation has earnings per share of $ 2.34 and the earnings per share growth for this year is 22.20%. The ROI is 16.00% and the return on equity for Intel Corporationas stated earlier, is currently at 20.30%.The return on assets (ROA) for Intel Corporation is 12.40%. \nThe earnings per share (EPS) is a direct measure of a companys profit. EPS is calculated by subtracting dividends from profits and dividing it by the total number of shares outstanding.\nThe return on investment (ROI) is the money a company has made or lost on an investment  in simple terms. \nThe return on equity (ROE) measures the companys profitability and the efficiency at which it is generating those profits. ROE is calculated by dividing the total profit by total amount of money invested in the company. \nThe return on assets (ROA) is a very useful indicator that illustrates how profitable a company really is in relation to its total assets. ROA is calculated by dividing the total annual earnings by the companys total assets.\n\nDividends and Price Earnings Ratio\nIntel Corporation has a dividend yield of 2.76%. The price/earnings ratio (P/E) is 14.88 and the forward P/E ratio stands at 14.71. The price to earnings growth is 1.8 and the price to sales growth is 2.98. \nThe price/earnings ratio (P/E) is one of the best known investment valuation indicators. P/E is calculated by dividing the trailing 12 months earnings per share by the present share price. Typically, a high P/E ratio means that the investors are paying more for todays earnings in hopes of future growth in earnings. \nThe forward price to earnings ratio, as the name suggests, is used to find the future price to earnings ratio. It is calculated by dividing the market price per share with the anticipated earnings per share.\nThe price to earnings growth ratio (PEG) is utilized for determining a stocks value in relation to the companys earnings. It helps to provide a more holistic picture with the P/E ratio. The PEG is calculated by dividing the price to earnings ratio by the annual earnings per share growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock is undervalued in relation to its earnings performance. \nVolume\nIntel Corporation has a 52-week low of 40.95% and 52-week high of -4.99%. The company has a 20-day simple moving average of 4.82% and a volume of 4.82%. The average volume stands around 27914.83.\nVolume is the amount of shares that trade hands  in simple terms. \nTechnical\nThe technical stats for Intel Corporation are as follows.\nIntel Corporation has a simple moving average of 4.82% over the last 20 days. The simple moving average for the last 200 days stands at 12.00%. Intel Corporation has a beta of 0.92 and the weekly and monthly volatility stands at 2.15% and 1.89% respectively. \nA simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of the stock for the given time periods, say for 20 days, and then dividing it by that time period- i.e 20. It usually helps to smooth out the noise by filtering out random price movements. Since SMA is based on past data, it will tend to have a lag. The longer the time period the greater the lag. So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. \nBeta is used to measure the volatility of the stock. A beta of less than 1 means that it is less volatile than the market and a beta of greater than 1 means that it is more volatile than the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock will move with the market.\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\nVolatility, in simple terms, is an indicator of how risky the stock is. It is the amount of uncertainty or riskabout the magnitude of changes in a stocks value. Higher volatility means that a stocks price can change radically in either direction in a very short period of time and lower volatility is just the opposite, as the price doesnt change dramatically  instead it varies at a steady pace over a significantly longer period of time. \n\n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and information expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any company stakeholders, financial professionals, or analysts.

Manufacturers typically add rubber flaps or gaskets to protect the openings people plug intoon a daily basisfor data, headphones and more. But a new invention from Apple suggests a future iPhone -- perhaps an iPhone 7 -- could come with covers that wouldnt need to be removed, aiding in its efforts to better protectthe smartphone from moisture.\nAn Apple Inc. patent application published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Thursday, titled Electronic Device With Hidden Connector, details a gadget that comes with a layer of self-healing elastomer applied over one or more of its external connectors. This can be a number of ports such as the Lightning port, or the 3.5mm headphone jack. The elastomer cover would allow temporary penetration of a probe found on a cable. But after the cable is removed, the cover could then reform and "heal" itself.\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n                  A diagram illustrates how a sealed port cover would allow a probe to temporarily penetrate its surface.\n                          Photo: USPTO/Apple Inc.\n              \n      \n\nWhile Apple uses a smartphone as an example for the use of the invention, it also notes that it could be used for a number of its devices such as Apple Watches, MacBooks, iMacs and Apple TV.\nOfficially, Apple doesnt say its iPhone is waterproof or even water-resistant. But several tests have shown that in some situations its smartphone could survive a quick dip into the drink. A teardown from repair website iFixit has also revealed the addition of additional rubber gaskets in the iPhone 6S. Apple also has additional patents pointing to a process that protects the iPhones internals through the use of a hydrophobic coatingand a method to eject water from speaker ports.\n  \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n                  A flowchart illustrating how the self-healing elastomer cover would function.\n                          Photo: USPTO/Apple Inc.\n              \n      \n\nAs with most of Apples patents and patent applications, its unknown if or when it plans to use it in one of its products. Apple first filed the patent application on June 9, 2014, and credits Apple engineers David Nazzaro, Ibuki Kamei and designer Tyler Bushnell for the invention.\n      \n    '

S'\n                    For many years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has adopted what many call a "tick-tock" methodology (obviously borrowing the phrase from a certain large chipmaker) for its iPhone lineup. In even-numbered years, the company will introduce an iPhone with a new number, such as the iPhone 5 and 6; in odd-numbered years, the company takes the same basic phone design as in the previous year but adds a whole lot of goodness under the hood.\nAlthough this development process has generally worked well for the iDevice maker, I believe it is now outdated. Indeed, in this article, I plan to show it\'s time for Apple to shift to a release cadence in which the company releases totally new phones each and every year.\nWhy this has historically made sense Traditionally, many buyers -- particularly those in the United States -- would buy smartphones on two-year carrier contracts, effectively meaning users would upgrade their devices every two years.\nWith such plans being commonplace, it made perfect sense for Apple to introduce a new phone and then an upgraded "s" model. Whether a user was on the "new number" cycle or the "s" cycle didn\'t matter; these buyers would have two years\' worth of improvements to look forward to.\nAnd in the early innings of the smartphone boom, two years\' worth of innovation was a huge deal.\nThe concept is outdated today, though According to market research firm IDC, worldwide smartphone growth is cooling off, with worldwide industry growth expected to slow to just 9.8% in 2015. IDC also expects the five-year compounded annual growth rate for the smartphone market at large will come in at just 7.4% in the 2015 to 2019 period.\nIDC says smartphone sales in mature markets (such as the United States) will be driven principally by "replacement purchases and second devices." To this end, the firm thinks smartphone makers will "push device financing and trade-in options" such as Apple\'s recently announced "iPhone Upgrade Program" to try to quicken device upgrade cycles.\nIf Apple is serious about trying to get people to upgrade every year (rather than every two years), then I would expect the company to ax its current "tick-tock" development methodology and instead release fundamentally new phones each year.\nWhat will it mean for Apple from a financial perspective? Apple has grown its revenue significantly over the last several years, which has allowed it to dramatically ramp up its research and development spending from where it was early on during the smartphone boom:\n\nApple\'s research and development budget has skyrocketed. Source: YChart.\nThis dramatically increased spending means Apple has the resources to be more aggressive in producing new designs and implementing new features each year. I suspect Apple already realizes it needs to make bigger jumps with each iPhone release than it has previously, so I don\'t believe the company needs to further increase research and development spending to support this.\nThe only area where I could see Apple taking somewhat of a hit is on the gross profit margin front as the company will be able to reuse fewer components from the prior-generation models (most components tend to decline in price year over year).\nWith that in mind, it\'s worth noting with the iPhone 6s, Apple upgraded just about every single component in the latest iPhones over the prior generation models, with perhaps the LCD panel being the only major, noticeable component that stayed the same year over year.\nDespite this, Apple guided to gross profit margins for its fiscal first quarter that should be about flat with those seen a year earlier; Apple may very well be able to transition to full redesigns each year without taking too much of a hit (if any) on the gross profit margin side of things.\n3 Companies Poised to Explode When Cable Dies Cable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone utilities, stockbrokers, record companies, bookstores, travel agencies, and big box retailers did when the Internet swept away their business models.

Hint: They\'re not the ones you\'d think!\n                    \n                '

S'\n                    Ever since 2011,Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung(NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) have been locked in a patent fight, with neither party willing to budge. However, it seems as though both companies have grown weary of this debilitating fight and are in the process of sealing an agreement.\nIn this video segment, The Motley Fool\'s Dylan Lewis and Vincent Shen explain why Samsung is forking over $550 million to its arch rival, what it signals about the relationship between the two companies, and whythis might just end up backfiring on Apple in the long run.\nListen to the full podcast by clickinghere. A transcript follows the video.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.\n\nThis podcast was recorded on Dec. 4, 2015.\nVincent Shen: So are Samsung and Apple kissing and making up here, or what?\nDylan Lewis: I don\'t know, maybe they get into the holiday spirit a little bit, right? So early this week Samsung basically agreed to pay Apple roughly $550 million as part of this long-running patent dispute that they\'ve had. Their patent disputes last longer than most relationships at this point.\nShen: 5 years running.\nLewis: Yeah which is insane. I mean I guess it\'s just a testament to how much they\'ve dug their heels in and just fought each other on this.\nBasically this dates back to 2011. Apple said Samsung was using some of its patented technologies without permission. One of the ones that was cited in some of the examples was the pinch to zoom functionality in OS. Just to give you an idea of what this case centers on.\nAnd so this $550 million seems like a big number. The reality is, it\'s the fraction of what the original sticker price that Apple was asking for was, which was like $2.5 billion.\nShen: Oh, wow!\nLewis: And courts had originally awarded Apple $1 billion. Samsung through a series of appeals and things like that, talked them down to this $550 million figure.\nShen: Okay. Is this it? Is it over?\nLewis: No. That\'s the problem with this litigation process, right? It\'s never over. And of course in terms of like what does this mean for Apple, this is a drop in the bucket for their top line.\nYou know you look at the $200 billion plus that they made. This is nothing over the last year.\nShen: Yeah of course.\nLewis: So I kind of wanted to bring it up because I think I\'m hoping that it marks more the end of this like highly litigious 6 for these two companies. You know, you look back and like the 2010 to present really period, and it\'s just been brutal in terms of patent attacks.\nAnd it\'s something that Steve Jobs was very adamant about was protecting tech and patenting pretty much everything. And I think that there\'s definitely something to be said for that, but I think that this might be the two companies, in addition to some of the other things they\'ve done, turning the corner a little bit and hopefully burying the hatchet.\nActually in 2014 the two agreed to drop their patent disputes outside the U.S. And so they had ongoing patent disputes in nine other countries at the time.\nShen: Oh, wow!\nLewis: Yeah it\'s just insane when you think about the scope that this runs. And I think one of the crazier stats that I came across when I was researching this story was just in 2012, New York Times had this article and they mentioned last time, last year for the first time, spending by Apple and Googleon patent lawsuits and unusually big dollar patent purchases exceeded spending on research and development of new products according to public filings. Which is insane.\nShen: Just to give you an idea of how long this has been going on, how expensive it is for them to wage this battle in court against each other over such a long period of time. It\'s really big numbers.\nLewis: Yeah and I think some of this is just the maturation of people getting used to having this functionality on their phones and different devices. And so like if a feature\'s been around for so many years, at what point do you say like this is something that people are used to being able to do on their phones?\nYeah, there\'s definitely that element of it. So but I do think that both companies are tiring of it a little bit and maybe their mom called up and said, "You guys need to play nice so that I\'ll feed you guys over the holidays or something." But there\'s still some elements of this that need to pass through. So basically Samsung said once they received notice of invoice from Apple, they will pay it within 10 days.\nSamsung is of course requesting a Supreme Court review of the case so there is an appeal in there, but they are willing to pay the fine right now. And there is a clause written into this payment that Samsung would be refunded the money should the U.S. Patent and Trade office find that the patent should not have been issued in the first place. Which is something that has come up a couple times with some of these patents.\nShen: Yeah I\'ve heard that the USPTO has some like internal investigations right now where they\'re evaluating where some of those early patents that they awarded to Apple might not, should not have been awarded in the first place. So this is kind of over.\nLewis: Yeah. There will probably be a follow-up at some point but I think more than anything else, this is just kind of more like the fascinating side of tech that you don\'t really hear about much. There\'s some really interesting stuff written about the patent process and kind of arming yourself with patents.\nAnd I kind of urge our listeners to check that out if this is something you\'re interested in. They get into the process that some of these big tech companies use just because they have these huge legal resources. And some of it is just resubmitting and resubmitting and resubmitting it. It\'s like this war of attrition kind of against the U.S. Patent Office. And so that\'s where you start to see these, "should these patents have been issued to begin with" type things.\nBut really fascinating stuff. I\'m hoping that the two companies can just kind of let it go at this point and play nice.\nShen: That $550 million settlement -- I\'m not saying it\'s a small amount of money by any means. To these companies though overall it is pretty much a drop in the bucket. But I think about it, I remember when these, when this legal battle first kicked off back in 2010, 2011, at the time when the Android-Apple war was raging full on, I felt like this was almost like a symbolic perception of which company is leading the charge in terms of developments of smartphones. Like Apple basically claiming, "We started it all. Samsung\'s just copying us with their devices." But honestly at this point, 5 years later there\'s a lot of good phones out there. I just don\'t think people care that much anymore.\n                    \n                '

(AAPL) willbe hauling in mind-bogglingrevenues as customersline up to get their hands on the latest and greatest from the worlds most valuable company.\nThat said, I doubtpeople will be lining up around the block for Apples newest product, the iPhone Smart Battery Case. AAPL surprised the tech community by releasing the unannounced case, which not only protects your phone, but charges it at the same time.\nApple claims it can increase talk time by up to 25 hours, and it works with the iPhone 6 and 6s models (sorry, Plus-sized models).\nSounds great, right? So why exactly is this so embarrassing for Apple and nerve-racking for AAPL investors?\nAdmission That The Battery Is Inadequate\nBy releasing theSmart Battery Case, AAPL is essentially admitting the smaller-sized iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s have unsatisfactory battery life. For a company thathas always prized itself on making sleek, stylish, high-performance products that simplify the experience for the user, this is a departure from the norm.\n5 Stocks That Could Be Cut In HALF\nSimply put, there shouldnt be the need for a product that extends battery life  that shouldve been taken care of the first go-round.\nPerhaps more disconcerting is the fact that the case is debuting justthree months after the September release of the iPhone 6s  which meansAAPL actually knew the iPhone 6s battery life wasinadequate.\nWho knows how many$99 cases Apple will sell, but as an AAPL shareholder myself, I see each sale as a confirmation that the company has strayed from its core values. Can we honestly imagine such a release happening under Steve Jobs? Whats next? Will Apple release the iPhone 7 next year, then sell you the camera separately?\nThe fact that CEO Tim Cook is already publicly defending the decision is also quite un-Apple-like. Apple shouldnt have to defend itself. Its a proven trendsetter.\nDesign Issues With Case Itself\nLets recap AAPL CEO Tim Cooks rookie move three-step: 1) He oversaw the release of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s, which both had miserable battery life; 2) He acknowledged and embraced this shortcoming by releasing a $99 Smart Battery Case, making AAPL look desperate and sloppy; and 3) He hastily rushed to defend the case in aMashableinterview, giving off an air of weakness and desperation.\nIt gets worse, though. The case itself is not at all sleek or aesthetically pleasing: Theres a noticeable humpon the back of it that users have been voicing complaints about. That was the issue Cook actually focused on in his defensive stand. Admittedly, there was a practical reason for the hump: It helps you slide the phone in and out of the case easily.\nAt the end of the day, this isnt going to be the straw that broke the camels back. Alphabet Incs (GOOG, GOOGL) Android may own the most market share in smartphones, but Apple makes dramaticallymore money by controlling both the hardware and software behind their devices.\nThat said, tech changes rapidly, and if AAPL loses its edge in design or ticks off customers too much through botched products and follow-on products like this, shareholders will have reason to worry.\nAs of this writing, John Divine was long AAPL stock.

S'\n                           Rumors about whether Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will ditch the headphone jack in the next generation iPhone have done the rounds for quite some time now and yet there is no official confirmation or contradiction. Now that Audeze has introduced a pair of lightning cable headphones, the possibility that Apple will ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack has seemingly become more likely. However, Bidness Etc highlights why Apple should not be tempted by the offer.\nApple focuses on innovation that has already been introduced or is currently under development at other manufacturers. However, it surprised many with the 3D Touch display in the iPhone 6s. Unsurprisingly Apple would be tempted to ditch the headphone jack in the next generation of the iPhone, although we believe the thought hasnt even crossed the minds of decision makers at any other smartphone company. This would further solidify the untouchable image of the iPhone in the eyes of many.\nToo Much Of A Risk, Even for Apple\nWith the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s, Apple has successfully raked in amounts that have left other manufacturers in the dust. The company would want to do very much the same or even better with its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The removal of the headphone jack might just allow the company to introduce an even thinner iPhone however this entails a massive risk. Currently, conventional headphone come in the 3.5mm thickness and are supported by most devices. These would become useless with the next iPhone, if the jack is removed. Audeze latest lightning headphones are priced at $800; thats even more expensive than the 64GB model of the iPhone 6s. Surely not many would shell out that kind of money for headphones. Therefore Apple would be better off sticking with the headphone jack.\nWhat Happens To Beats?\nApple recently acquired Beats and has finally begun to promote its portfolio of products. What will happen to these products if Apple removes the headphone jack? Yes Beats has quite a few headphones which function without the jack, however one cannot deny that most of the portfolio of products uses the headphone jack.\nIt appears that our imaginations of a lighting port connected to headphones has come true however it is not under the Beats banner. Although Audeze has beaten Apple to the punch however rest assured a Beats lightning headphones will be on its way if Apple does decide to ditch the jack.\nFor now we cant come to terms with the rumors that the next iPhone will be jack-less. There appears to be too much at stake for Apple to introduce such a radical change in as little as nine months. The concept of withholding a headphone jack from its iPhone remains a possibility that they could turn to in the near future, we believe now is far from the right time to do so.

S"\n                    It's no secret that 2015 has been a terrible year for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Revenue collapsed as the company lost market share to both Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the GPU market, a situation made worse by sluggish demand for PCs. AMD has reported a net loss in each of the last four quarters, and during 2015, the company wrote off inventory related to its APUs on two separate occasions. During the third quarter, revenue declined by 26% year over year.\nDespite all of the problems AMD is facing, 2016 has the potential to be the best year for the company in quite some time. On the CPU front, AMD plans to launch a new CPU architecture, called Zen, toward the end of the year, promising major performance improvements. On the GPU front, AMD plans to revamp its entire lineup, doubling performance-per-watt in the hopes of being more competitive with NVIDIA. And on the semi-custom front, AMD will begin booking revenue for its latest design wins during the second half of 2016.\nZen could be a big deal AMD made a major misstep in 2011 with its Bulldozer microarchitecture, and its subsequent revisions haven't solved the core problem. In terms of single-threaded performance, comparable Intel processors vastly outperformed AMD's efforts, and the company's shares of both the PC market and server market collapsed. According to Bloomberg, Intel chips find their way into more than 80% of PCs, and Intel has a near monopoly in the server chip market.\nZen has the potential to make AMD competitive once again. The company is promising that the new chips will bring a 40% increase in instructions-per-clock compared to AMD's previous architecture, helping to close the performance gap with Intel. Zen will also be built on a FinFET process, most likely at 14nm. If AMD launches Zen on time, both AMD and Intel will be at 14nm at the same time, thanks to Intel's decision to push back the launch of its 10nm process to late 2017. If AMD can put out a competitive CPU, the company's market share could be due for a rebound in 2016.\nBattling NVIDIA AMD has also had trouble in the GPU market. The company has been losing market share throughout 2015, and at the moment, NVIDIA claims a unit market share of about 80%.\n\nData source: Jon Peddie Research.\nAMD's latest graphics card launch was mostly a dud. Its high-end products, the Fury and Fury X, failed to disrupt NVIDIA's lineup, and the rest of its new products were simply rebranded versions of older graphics cards. The much-touted high-bandwidth memory AMD included in its high-end GPUs failed to give the company an edge, and NVIDIA's gaming graphics cards continue to sell extremely well. During the third quarter, NVIDIA's gaming revenue jumped 44% year over year.\nIn 2016, both AMD and NVIDIA are expected to launch new graphics cards, and both companies are expected to move to either a 16nm or a 14nm process after being stuck at 28nm for years, in addition to using the second-generation of high-bandwidth memory. AMD has been playing catch-up ever since NVIDIA launched the GTX 970 and GTX 980 last year at disruptive price points, but if the company can release competitive products in 2016 alongside NVIDIA, it could begin to claw back some of its lost market share.\nSemi-custom growth Sales of semi-custom SoCs for use in the major game consoles have provided AMD with a much-needed source of revenue and profits, helping to partially offset weakness in the rest of its business. This revenue will eventually begin to decline, however, as sales of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One peak sometime in the next few years. At the moment, the game consoles are the only source of semi-custom revenue for AMD, but starting in late 2016, that will no longer be the case.\nAMD first announced two semi-custom design wins in late 2014, followed by a third design win earlier this year. The first two are expected to generate a total of $1 billion of revenue over the course of three years, beginning in 2016. During AMD's latest conference call, CEO Lisa Su confirmed that revenue from these products would begin during the second half of 2016. No details on the third win have been released, but it's possible it involves Nintendo's rumored NX game console.\nWith sales of the game consoles still going strong, and with new semi-custom revenue coming next year, 2016 is shaping up to be a solid year for AMD's semi-custom business.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early, in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.\n                    \n                "

(NASDAQMU), from the Technology sector had a price of $ 14.32 today, indicating a change of -1.92%. \nThe company is predicting an earnings per share growth of 70.55% in the coming year. The earnings per share growth over the next five years will be . Micron Technology, Inc. had an earnings per share growth of 6.00% in the last 5 years.\nCurrently the return on equity is 23.70% and its debt to equity is 0.6. Micron Technology, Inc. has a total market cap of $ 15547.94, a gross margin of 32.20% while the profit margin is 17.90% and the ROI is 14.20% \n\nPerformance\nThe stats on Micron Technology, Inc. are currently as follows.\nThe weekly performance is -9.48%, and the quarterly performance is at -16.74%. The monthly performance is -9.60% and the yearly performance is -59.84%. The performance for Year to Date (YTD) is -59.10%.\nMicron Technology, Inc. has earnings per share of $ 2.46 and the earnings per share growth for this year is -2.40%. The ROI is 14.20% and the return on equity for Micron Technology, Inc.as stated earlier, is currently at 23.70%.The return on assets (ROA) for Micron Technology, Inc. is 12.10%. \nThe earnings per share (EPS) is a direct measure of a companys profit. EPS is calculated by subtracting dividends from profits and dividing it by the total number of shares outstanding.\nThe return on investment (ROI) is the money a company has made or lost on an investment  in simple terms. \nThe return on equity (ROE) measures the companys profitability and the efficiency at which it is generating those profits. ROE is calculated by dividing the total profit by total amount of money invested in the company. \nThe return on assets (ROA) is a very useful indicator that illustrates how profitable a company really is in relation to its total assets. ROA is calculated by dividing the total annual earnings by the companys total assets.\n\nDividends and Price Earnings Ratio\nMicron Technology, Inc. has a dividend yield of *TBA. The price/earnings ratio (P/E) is 5.82 and the forward P/E ratio stands at 6.28. The price to earnings growth is 5.82 and the price to sales growth is 0.96. \nThe price/earnings ratio (P/E) is one of the best known investment valuation indicators. P/E is calculated by dividing the trailing 12 months earnings per share by the present share price. Typically, a high P/E ratio means that the investors are paying more for todays earnings in hopes of future growth in earnings. \nThe forward price to earnings ratio, as the name suggests, is used to find the future price to earnings ratio. It is calculated by dividing the market price per share with the anticipated earnings per share.\nThe price to earnings growth ratio (PEG) is utilized for determining a stocks value in relation to the companys earnings. It helps to provide a more holistic picture with the P/E ratio. The PEG is calculated by dividing the price to earnings ratio by the annual earnings per share growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock is undervalued in relation to its earnings performance. \nVolume\nMicron Technology, Inc. has a 52-week low of 6.07% and 52-week high of -60.02%. The company has a 20-day simple moving average of -13.08% and a volume of -13.08%. The average volume stands around 24577.64.\nVolume is the amount of shares that trade hands  in simple terms. \nTechnical\nThe technical stats for Micron Technology, Inc. are as follows.\nMicron Technology, Inc. has a simple moving average of -13.08% over the last 20 days. The simple moving average for the last 200 days stands at -33.17%. Micron Technology, Inc. has a beta of 2.06 and the weekly and monthly volatility stands at 3.62% and 3.47% respectively. \nA simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of the stock for the given time periods, say for 20 days, and then dividing it by that time period- i.e 20. It usually helps to smooth out the noise by filtering out random price movements. Since SMA is based on past data, it will tend to have a lag. The longer the time period the greater the lag. So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. \nBeta is used to measure the volatility of the stock. A beta of less than 1 means that it is less volatile than the market and a beta of greater than 1 means that it is more volatile than the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock will move with the market.\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\nVolatility, in simple terms, is an indicator of how risky the stock is. It is the amount of uncertainty or riskabout the magnitude of changes in a stocks value. Higher volatility means that a stocks price can change radically in either direction in a very short period of time and lower volatility is just the opposite, as the price doesnt change dramatically  instead it varies at a steady pace over a significantly longer period of time. \n\n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and information expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any company stakeholders, financial professionals, or analysts.

The earnings per share growth over the next five years will be . NVIDIA Corporation had an earnings per share growth of 62.50% in the last 5 years.\nCurrently the return on equity is 13.60% and its debt to equity is 0.32. NVIDIA Corporation has a total market cap of $ 17597.98, a gross margin of 56.00% while the profit margin is 12.30% and the ROI is 10.90% \n\nPerformance\nThe stats on NVIDIA Corporation are currently as follows.\nThe weekly performance is 0.65%, and the quarterly performance is at 45.41%. The monthly performance is 4.53% and the yearly performance is 60.41%. The performance for Year to Date (YTD) is 65.85%.\nNVIDIA Corporation has earnings per share of $ 1.07 and the earnings per share growth for this year is 51.40%. The ROI is 10.90% and the return on equity for NVIDIA Corporationas stated earlier, is currently at 13.60%.The return on assets (ROA) for NVIDIA Corporation is 8.40%. \nThe earnings per share (EPS) is a direct measure of a companys profit. EPS is calculated by subtracting dividends from profits and dividing it by the total number of shares outstanding.\nThe return on investment (ROI) is the money a company has made or lost on an investment  in simple terms. \nThe return on equity (ROE) measures the companys profitability and the efficiency at which it is generating those profits. ROE is calculated by dividing the total profit by total amount of money invested in the company. \nThe return on assets (ROA) is a very useful indicator that illustrates how profitable a company really is in relation to its total assets. ROA is calculated by dividing the total annual earnings by the companys total assets.\n\nDividends and Price Earnings Ratio\nNVIDIA Corporation has a dividend yield of 1.41%. The price/earnings ratio (P/E) is 30.57 and the forward P/E ratio stands at 24.19. The price to earnings growth is 7 and the price to sales growth is 3.62. \nThe price/earnings ratio (P/E) is one of the best known investment valuation indicators. P/E is calculated by dividing the trailing 12 months earnings per share by the present share price. Typically, a high P/E ratio means that the investors are paying more for todays earnings in hopes of future growth in earnings. \nThe forward price to earnings ratio, as the name suggests, is used to find the future price to earnings ratio. It is calculated by dividing the market price per share with the anticipated earnings per share.\nThe price to earnings growth ratio (PEG) is utilized for determining a stocks value in relation to the companys earnings. It helps to provide a more holistic picture with the P/E ratio. The PEG is calculated by dividing the price to earnings ratio by the annual earnings per share growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock is undervalued in relation to its earnings performance. \nVolume\nNVIDIA Corporation has a 52-week low of 75.57% and 52-week high of -3.25%. The company has a 20-day simple moving average of 13.09% and a volume of 13.09%. The average volume stands around 8801.13.\nVolume is the amount of shares that trade hands  in simple terms. \nTechnical\nThe technical stats for NVIDIA Corporation are as follows.\nNVIDIA Corporation has a simple moving average of 13.09% over the last 20 days. The simple moving average for the last 200 days stands at 39.81%. NVIDIA Corporation has a beta of 1.32 and the weekly and monthly volatility stands at 3.41% and 2.40% respectively. \nA simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of the stock for the given time periods, say for 20 days, and then dividing it by that time period- i.e 20. It usually helps to smooth out the noise by filtering out random price movements. Since SMA is based on past data, it will tend to have a lag. The longer the time period the greater the lag. So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. \nBeta is used to measure the volatility of the stock. A beta of less than 1 means that it is less volatile than the market and a beta of greater than 1 means that it is more volatile than the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock will move with the market.\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\nVolatility, in simple terms, is an indicator of how risky the stock is. It is the amount of uncertainty or riskabout the magnitude of changes in a stocks value. Higher volatility means that a stocks price can change radically in either direction in a very short period of time and lower volatility is just the opposite, as the price doesnt change dramatically  instead it varies at a steady pace over a significantly longer period of time. \n\n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and information expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any company stakeholders, financial professionals, or analysts.

S'\n                    During 2015, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) handily outperformed the S&P 500, appreciating 18% as the S&P 500 declined nearly 1%.\n\nMSFT data by YCharts\nPairing 2015 with the software giant\'s excellent 2014, and shares are up an impressive 46% during the past two years.\nWith such a significant rise in share price, has the valuation got out of hand?\nFrom undervalued to overvalued On March 22 of last year, I asserted that Microsoft was "an undervalued dividend stock." A 2.9% dividend yield, a sustainable business model, and a seemingly undervalued stock price represented a buying opportunity. But today\'s Microsoft stock isn\'t nearly as enticing. Since the time of this article, shares have soared 28%. And now the stock is borderline overvalued.\nHow did Microsoft go from undervalued to overvalued in such a short time?\nMicrosoft is undoubtedly a transformed company. Since CEO Satya Nadella took the reins in February 2014, the company pivoted toward an increased emphasis on mobile, cloud, and services. And there\'s already evidence the new focus is paying off handsomely.\n\nOffice 365 has been particularly successful under Nadella\'s reign, playing a key role in driving customer adoption of cloud services. Image source: Microsoft.\nBut is Microsoft\'s encouraging execution enough to merit such a huge jump in the company\'s share price during this period?\nValuation There are a number of ways to gauge whether or not the price for Microsoft stock makes sense in relation to the underlying value. The simplest methods would be to consider popular valuation metrics like price-to-earnings and price-to-sales in comparison to peers and in relation to recent growth. Microsoft\'s P/E and P/S ratios of 36 and 4.91, respectively, both imply the stock is probably pricey. Apple, for instance, has P/E and P/S ratios of 15.5 and 2.8, respectively, yet has managed to grow its EPS about 18% annually over the past five years while Microsoft\'s EPS has gone nowhere.\nBut for investors looking for a more concrete representation of what shares are trading at today compared to what their fair value is, a discounted cash flow valuation can be used.\nThe weakness of a DCF valuation, of course, is the forward-looking nature of growth assumptions required to calculate value, as present value is determined by discounting predicted cash flows. In Microsoft\'s case, even a fairly optimistic outlook for cash flow growth over the next 10 years suggests shares could be overvalued. Consider two scenarios, for instance.\n\n\n\nYear\n\nScenario 1: FCF Annual Growth Rate\n\nScenario 2: FCF Annual Growth Rate\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n9%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n8.6%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n8.1%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n7.7%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n7.3%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n7%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n6.6%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n6.3%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n6%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n5.7%\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\nPerpetuity\n\n\n3%\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\nScenario one predicts free cash flow increases by 9% in year one. This growth decelerates by a modest 5% annually to a rate of about 5.7% in year 10. For years beyond 10, it\'s estimated that Microsoft\'s free cash flow grows in line with the historical rate of inflation: 3%. Using a discount rate of 10%, the present value of these future cash flows is $59.35 per share -- leaving very little room for error in these predictions.\nIn a safer, and appropriately more conservative, prediction of future cash flows, Microsoft is hands-down overvalued. This scenario predicts that Microsoft\'s free cash flow increases at a rate of about 5% annually over the next 10 years and at 3% beyond year 10. In this scenario, the present value of future cash flows is $49.70 per share -- about 10% below today\'s share price.Scenario one, which we\'ll assume is the bull case, predicts free cash flow increases by 9% in year one. This growth decelerates by a modest 5% annually to a rate of about 5.7% in year 10. For years beyond 10, it\'s estimated that Microsoft\'s free cash flow grows in line with the historical rate of inflation: 3%. Using a discount rate of 10%, the present value of these future cash flows is $59.35 per share. With this valuation just 8% higher than where shares are trading today, this scenario leaves very little room for error in these cash flow predictions.\n\n\n\nMetric\n\nScenario 1\n\nScenario 2\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscount rate\n\n\n10%\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\nFair value of shares\n\n\n$59.35\n\n\n$49.70\n\n\n\n\nThese scenarios don\'t necessarily mean that it\'s time to sell Microsoft stock. Industry-leading companies like Microsoft with a proven history could outperform expectations. So if I owned Microsoft stock, I wouldn\'t sell. But the uninspiring outlook for the stock based on these two DCF valuations does suggest the stock isn\'t the buy it was last March.\n\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.\n\n                    \n                '

S'\n          \n              \n      Summary\n    \n        Lots of rumors refer to an Intel powered Surface Phone, in 2016.\n        \n        Microsoft is working on a Continuum feature compatible with x86 applications.\n        \n        Latest rumor source, near Microsoft, states that the old project for Spring 2016 is canceled, while Panas took the new project for Fall 2016.\n        \n        Intel will release the x3 LTE mid-end solutions and high-end Goldmont cores in mid 2016, in perfect time for the eventual Surface Phone.\n        \n        Microsoft is widening its market while Intel has a high growth potential and the chance to get better PC sales. Microsoft and Intel are a buy.\n        \n    \n  \n\n            \n\n\n              Rumors about Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) working on a Surface Phone have been quite pressing lately. In July, there was a specific rumor stating that a Surface Phone was coming in Spring 2016. While the news was "great," the time frame looked quite strange due to a series of issues concerning Intel Corporation (INTC), the team working on it and so on.Some days ago, the same source stated that things have quite changed, providing something that would be far more coherent to the actual Surface line and the future hardware availability. I would say that a Surface Phone will come for sure, but let\'s start step by step.Above concept by Nadir AslamJuly rumorIn July, Daniel Rubino, from Windows Central, wrote that its source could affirm that the Redmond company was working on a Surface Phone to be released in May 2016. That rumor was quite fascinating, but it has various project issues:the only partner suitable to power that phone is Intel, but new mid-market SoFIA solutions and high-end Goldmont cores will come only in mid 2016Microsoft is expected to release its new Surface 5 Pro, Surface Book 2 and next flagship Lumias in Fall 2016, not beforeWindows 10 Redstone is expected to be released in Summer 2016, not beforeIn fact, it came out that the project was an old one from the Nokia route and it had different projected time frames.Design and project coherencyIn October, Panos Panay said that "That\'s a question I get asked a lot," in response to an interview question about the Surface Phone. After that, he also said "Over time you want a consistent thread between the products, especially the hardware as well. I think what you have to think with overall devices is making sure we are able to get that consistent premium fit and finish that people are expecting from Microsoft." In Panay\'s opinion, that fit and finish involve "consistency across design" and "consistency across craftsmanship".This is not a clear and loud statement that a Surface Phone will happen, but it is very likely that they are working on some kind of Surface-inspired Lumia or directly a Surface Phone version.Another hint comes from an article where various new phone prototypes and Surface Minis have been discovered during a visit at Building-87.x86 Continuum and Continuum-ContinuityA tweet about Kevin Gallo (VP, Windows Developer Platform) reports that Microsoft is working on implementing Win32 app compatibility in Continuum mode. Pay attention to "working on." Nothing is sure, but they are surveying if such a feature would be sensible (yes) and if it is technically feasible. We must remember that such a feature would require x86 hardware, implying the obvious Intel presence.Additionally, with Windows 10 Redstone slated for next summer, Windows will implement Continuity-like features, where universal apps and Microsoft features will be synchronized in real-time between smartphones and PCs, making possible chats and phone calls directly between smartphones and PCs.Core M tested in phabletsIn a previous article, I have written about the chance to see a Surface Phone powered by a clocked down Core M or its derivatives. That idea was driven by Intel, which is testing Core M with phablets for unspecified objectives. It is clear that these kinds of tests are keen to the idea of providing the right hardware in order to power a smartphone-PC in the near future. Testing a Core M is probably a way to survey how much the 4.5 TDP is excessive for such a device, and if the Skylake architecture is suitable to drive a smartphone or if it needs some tweaks or heavy mods.HTML5 leaked testSome days ago, a leaked test was reported, showing a "Surface Phone" benchmarked with HTML5. It was outdated, with outdated specs and outdated Windows and Edge versions. Therefore, it could be both a false rumor or some kind of test product, maybe belonging to the previous Lumia route. In any case, it is probably another sign that something is in store from Microsoft.Fall 2016 rumorThe last rumor is still reported by Daniel Rubino, from Windows Central. It came out that Microsoft decided to shut down the prior project from the Lumia route, in order to start a new project with Panos Panay, the creator of the new Surface line - a decision consistent with the design and craftsmanship coherency.It is also known that this project is developed jointly with Intel and it is likely to follow the "consistency across design" and "consistency across craftsmanship" in relation to the Surface line. This project is slated for Fall 2016, meeting the Redstone and new Atom release, not forgetting that Fall 2016 is the time window for the next Surface and high-end Lumia update.The potential of a Surface PhoneAnyway, the most important topic is whether such a device would have a market. My personal opinion is yes, of course.Even if we consider the x86 Continuum feature alone, it would add a feature, which is not achievable by competitors. Such a smartphone would reach a productivity level unrivaled once connected to an external monitor, by wireless or cables. For easy tasks and certain needs, it would be able to substitute PCs that are over rated for the majority of common usage, with the added value of having a pocket PC inside the trouser pocket. For other users, it would be simply an additional feature that would make it preferable to competitors\' smartphones, without touching their own PC needs.But, if we also consider the entire ecosystem, what Continuum is now and what it will be, what will come with the Redstone update and the chance to use traditional apps for not demanding tasks (which is the need of the majority of common users), we see that Microsoft is probably finding the right route to heavily enter the smartphone market, directly from the high-end, exploiting a specific and interesting function.There is still the problem of app availability and quality, still far from the iOS or Android platform. Unfortunately, the fourth bridge, Project Astoria, got paused due to various management concerns; therefore, Android apps will not be supported to run on Windows 10 at least for a while.There are still three bridges in order to raise the number and quality of Windows mobile apps:Project Centennial, in order to convert Win32 and .NET apps to Universal Applications (potential of 16 million apps),Project Islandwood, in order to port iOS apps to Windows. It needs more code effort compared to Project Astoria,Project Westminster, in order to reduce a website into a web app.These projects will surely push on the worst aspect of Windows Mobile, which is its app store. In any case, Windows 10 may be able to overcome the lack of sufficient traditional mobile apps through unique bridge apps that connect the mobile environment to the traditional desktop applications. The chance to use traditional desktop applications, with a mobile counterpart that exploits a full "continuum" between the mobile and desktop apps, could be something very disruptive, given the actual Windows installed base. At the moment, more than 150 million PCs run Windows 10 and, while the upgrading is slowing slightly, it is expected to see a spike during holiday sales and later.The takeawayGiven first positive reviews about Lumia 950 and 950 XL, a Surface Phone and/or x86 Continuum would be a very good and interesting innovation in the mobile scenario.Microsoft is likely to release the Surface Phone as a high-end premium device, with a metal magnesium chassis and the most powerful new Atom SoCs. I would not exclude the release of a mid-end smartphone, with a plastic chassis and a SoFIA x3 mid-end solution, in order to widen the market penetration.The potential of such kind of a device is very high and it is likely to see tens of millions of devices sold in the first months, providing good revenues for Microsoft\'s mobile sector. If we account for an ASP of $650, production, testing and transporting cost about $225 per device and something around 10 million devices sold, we can see a gross profit around $4 billion and revenues around $6.5 billion. But, given the peculiarity of this device and its ability to partially substitute traditional PC or Tablets devices, an higher ASP could really be expected already from the first year.We must not forget that Windows can be adopted by other OEMs, being Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Motorola (NYSE:MSI), Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), Huawei, LG, Asus (OTC:ASUUY) or others. Once Continuum will adopt x86 functionality and traditional desktop applications will be able to run on x86 smartphones, it is to be expected an OEM run to implement Windows on various smartphone solutions. This is the other part of Microsoft\'s strategy, keen to generate revenues from Windows related services. With a market of 1.5 billion smartphones shipped per year, this is a very big revenue source to attack and exploit.I personally rate Microsoft and Intel with a buy rating. Microsoft is going to expand and grow its own business, modifying its business strategies and attacking emerging markets. If it will release a Surface Phone or x86 Continuum, things will get very interesting. For what concerns Intel, I have already explained my recent market and technology view (1-2), also in relation to a potential Surface Phone. Accounting also for network virtualization and cloud growth, Intel is poised to considerably grow in the next years. Additionally, there is a growing feeling that PC sales are going to get better:late Skylake market entry,strong demand for Skylake processors,second Skylake FAB ramping in Ireland,high gaming GPU card sales,consistent OEM offer for 2-in-1 devices,too high quantity of >4 years old PC/laptops,Gartner analysis states that PC sales will get better starting from 4Q 2015,Indian and US laptop sales are already positive from 2Q,Gartner talks about stability for 2H 2016 and growth for the following years, driven by PC updates.These driving factors are more than a mere sign that things are going to get better, and it is clear that Intel\'s actual stock price is "hold" only by PC sales concern. Eventual up-revisions or IDC/Gartner positive updates would trigger a stock price spike.\n          \n              (function(){\n                   var disclosureHtmlStr = "<div id=\\\'article_body_top\\\' class=\\\'disclosure_top hidden\\\'><div id=\\\'inner_disclosure\\\'><!--googleoff: index--><strong>Disclosure: <\\/strong>I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. <span onclick=\\\'SA.Modules.Article.Disclosure.expand()\\\' id=\\\'more_button\\\' style=\\\'cursor:pointer\\\'><strong>(More...)<\\/strong><\\/span><span id=\\\'business_disclosure\\\' class=\\\'hidden\\\'>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

S'\n          \n              \n      Summary\n    \n        Microsoft entered the smartphone race too late, BlackBerry did not adapt to change.\n        \n        Both platforms never really gained traction, because developers were reluctant to commit and produce the kinds of apps they developed for Apple and Android.\n        \n        As a result, both platforms have failed miserably.\n        \n    \n  \n\n            \n\n\n              Even if BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY) is credited with inventing the modern day smartphone, it was a latecomer with regards to change. After Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the iPhone, it failed to see its significance, and the new wave of change. BlackBerry\'s management laughed at Apple at the time, and shareholders have paid the price.And after Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) introduced Android - and gave it free to OEM phone manufacturers around the world - it was already too late.By the time BlackBerry updated its devices and OS, there were very few developers willing to write applications for its OS. As a result, BlackBerry was never able to close the app gap, that attributed to its loss of market share.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was also a latecomer to the smartphone race. Microsoft tried to copy the Google-Android model, but without much luck. Initially Microsoft did attract developers, but when device sales stalled, developers we reluctant to commit to the platform, since they made very little money.Seeing that its strategy was failing, and that very few smartphone manufactures wanted to commit to the Windows Phone platform, Microsoft persuaded Nokia (NYSE:NOK) to abandon its platform and commit exclusively to Window Phones. However, while Nokia made some very good phones, the lack of apps was a deterrent for consumers.Finally, Microsoft bought out Nokia\'s device division to take over the smartphone business. Microsoft had no choice, since no smartphone manufacturer wanted to commit enough to its platform, since sales were not fermenting.As a result, the problem with missing apps has continued and the situation is actually deteriorating. Recently The Verge reported that more and more high-profile apps have disappeared or are simply not being updated anymore:American Airlines, Chase Bank, Bank of America, NBC, Pinterest, and Kabam have all discontinued their Windows Phone apps in the past year. These huge apps have simply disappeared or will no longer be updated. Some companies have cited a lack of Windows Phone users, and others have remained silent, but each removal has put Microsoft another step behind in the mobile race.But it\'s not just third party developers that are jumping ship, Microsoft itself is also to blame:Microsoft has removed several MSN apps and its popular Photosynth app, and the software maker has also killed off a number of special Lumia camera apps. Windows Phone users still don\'t have great Skype or Office apps like Microsoft produces for the iPhone. It\'s stunning that, after five years, the best experience of using Skype or Office on a phone isn\'t on one powered by WindowsAs a result, the Windows Phone platform has been steadily losing market share over the past year. In fact, Microsoft is trailing BlackBerry in market share loss. According to Gartner, the Windows Phone OS had 3% worldwide market share as of Q3 of 2014, and come Q3 of 2015, Windows OS has fallen to 1.7%.(click to enlarge)And if you think this is bad, it gets worse. Gartner says that total worldwide smartphone sales increased by 15.5% during this period.And even though there is much excitement and anticipation about Windows 10, and how that might invigorate Windows Phone sales, Gartner thinks otherwise:Despite the announcement of Windows 10, we expect Windows smartphone market share will continue to be a small portion of the overall smartphone OS market as consumers remain attracted by competing ecosystems," said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner. "Microsoft smartphones will mainly focus on driving value for enterprise users.Is Gartner talking about Microsoft or BlackBerry folks?But it gets even worse. That\'s right, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer dropped a bombshell recently at Microsoft\'s annual shareholder meeting.While criticizing Microsoft\'s current CEO Satya Nadella, about the lack of app availability, Ballmer said "the company needs to enable Windows Phones to run Android apps".I mean, does this sound like BlackBerry deja vu or what? Remember, in the beginning BlackBerry offered rewards to developers who made the coolest apps. After that, it made tools to make it easy for developers to port apps to BB10. Finally, when everything else failed, BlackBerry simply adopted Android with the recent introduction of the Priv.Ballmer did not exactly say that Microsoft must abandon its own OS and make devices for Android, however the message is clear. Microsoft has lost the smartphone race. And while I never say never, the chances of Microsoft regaining any sort of decent marketshare in the smartphone space, is as of now, little to none.BlackBerry has one last chance with the Priv, however as I said in a recent article (please consider: If You Are Thinking About Buying BlackBerry Because Of The Priv, Think Again), I do not think the Priv will succeed.Bottom lineIn theory Microsoft can continue the smartphone race indefinitely, because it has the cash and the revenue from other sources to subsidize its smartphone effort.However if Gartner is correct (and I think it will prove to be), Microsoft\'s smartphone effort will probably be restricted to making smart devices (phones and tablets) that complement many of its other products and services that cater to its enterprise customers.And as BlackBerry proved, device sales to the enterprise alone will probably not be enough to make a big difference to Microsoft\'s financials and stock price. You either sell massively to the consumer, or there is not much of a point.Lucky for Microsoft, its business and its stock price does not depend upon the success of its Windows Phone platform. Microsoft has been doing just fine without it. Furthermore, even the several billions it spent so far - and will probably be written down at some point - have not taken a toll on its stock.I have been wrong in the past about Microsoft\'s smartphone effort (please consider: Should Microsoft Make A Smartphone?). I actually thought Microsoft would be able to take a good piece of the market, something that could have caused its stock to double, given how much money Apple is able to make.For the time being at least, that seems like a distant dream, and Microsoft might follow BlackBerry\'s footsteps, if Ballmer gets his wish to allow Android apps to run on Windows Phones.And if that ever happens, Microsoft\'s smartphone consumer division will probably be history, just as BlackBerry\'s BB10 devices already are.And while I think BlackBerry has a small chance to remain in the game with the Priv, I think it\'s probably game over for Microsoft after Ballmer\'s comments, and its y/o/y sliding marketshare numbers.Sometimes is does not matter if you make a better device, or a better service. Sometimes all that matters is who entered the race first to entrenched themselves, and who was able to adapt to change when it accrued. Microsoft failed on both accounts, as did BlackBerry.And when the history of smartphones is written many years from now, both companies will probably be mentioned in a parenthesis.\n          \n              (function(){\n                   var disclosureHtmlStr = "<div id=\\\'article_body_top\\\' class=\\\'disclosure_top hidden\\\'><div id=\\\'inner_disclosure\\\'><!--googleoff: index--><strong>Disclosure: <\\/strong>I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. <span onclick=\\\'SA.Modules.Article.Disclosure.expand()\\\' id=\\\'more_button\\\' style=\\\'cursor:pointer\\\'><strong>(More...)<\\/strong><\\/span><span id=\\\'business_disclosure\\\' class=\\\'hidden\\\'>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

ADBE stock was already up 22% in 2015 before the impressive results.\nLast quarter was just the latest confirmation that Adobe is a quality company that does a few things really well: Photoshop, Acrobat and Flashare its threeflagship products, and each is widely used in its respective area. On the heels of Q4 results, the Adobe brands strength proves yet again that its the companys most valuable asset.\nThankfully for ADBE stock owners, the company is also brilliantly leveraging that asset through the cloud.\nFrankly, the cloud has been a godsend for Adobe, and its the main reason analysts expectthe companys revenue growth to actually accelerate in both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.\nLets take a look at its most recent quarter, and why it bodes well for ADBE stock:\n5 Stocks You MUST Watch in 2016\nBe Proud of the Cloud\nShares of other big-name application and enterprise software companies like SAP (SAP), Autodesk (ADSK) and Oracle (ORCL) havent been able to keep up with ADBE this year, and after Thursdays results its even less likely theyll catch up.\nAdobe logged its ninthstraight quarterly profits beat; adjusted earnings per share clocked in at 62 cents vs. consensus estimates for 60 cents. Net incomeof $311.9 million was upa whopping 59% from the year-ago profit of $195.7 million, which broke down to an EPS of 39 cents.\nFourth-quarter revenue met expectations, growing 22% year-over-year to reach $1.31 billion.\nSubscriber growth to Adobes Creative Cloud  a group of software tools including Photoshop, Dreamweaver and Flash, drove revenue, as members increased by 833,000 to 6.17 million. That was much higher than the 678,200 new members analysts expected.\nCustomers have the option of subscribing to the full suite of software products or individual products, and of the individual ones Photoshop Lightroom experienced the fastest growth.Interestingly, Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett attributed this growth largely to hobbyists and consumers and people that would never buy the Creative products before.\nSubscription revenues are ADBEs bread and butter. Of the three broad categories Adobes revenue is broken up into  subscription, product, and services and support  subscription is the only one that grew year-over-year. Since its by far the largest segment, making up 69% of revenue, and because its growing like crazy (up 44% in Q4), thats not so worrisome.\nBottom Line for ADBE Stock\nI applaud Adobe for putting together another great quarter and capping off a solid year. Adoption of the cloud should continue to be a strong catalyst for the company going forward, and the fact that hobbyists and creative types are driving growth right now serves as testament to Adobes strong brand and reputation.\nDespitenow being up about 26% in 2015, ADBE stock remains a strong buy going forward.\nAs of this writing, John Divine did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

A beta of less than 1 means that it is less volatile than the market and a beta of greater than 1 means that it is more volatile than the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock will move with the market.\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\nVolatility, in simple terms, is an indicator of how risky the stock is.

The earnings per share growth over the next five years will be . Intel Corporation had an earnings per share growth of 24.60% in the last 5 years.\nCurrently the return on equity is 20.30% and its debt to equity is 0.37. Intel Corporation has a total market cap of $ 164079.63, a gross margin of 62.90% while the profit margin is 20.80% and the ROI is 16.00% \n\nPerformance\nThe stats on Intel Corporation are currently as follows.\nThe weekly performance is 2.14%, and the quarterly performance is at 18.82%. The monthly performance is 4.70% and the yearly performance is -1.66%. The performance for Year to Date (YTD) is -1.31%.\nIntel Corporation has earnings per share of $ 2.34 and the earnings per share growth for this year is 22.20%. The ROI is 16.00% and the return on equity for Intel Corporationas stated earlier, is currently at 20.30%.The return on assets (ROA) for Intel Corporation is 12.40%. \nThe earnings per share (EPS) is a direct measure of a companys profit. EPS is calculated by subtracting dividends from profits and dividing it by the total number of shares outstanding.\nThe return on investment (ROI) is the money a company has made or lost on an investment  in simple terms. \nThe return on equity (ROE) measures the companys profitability and the efficiency at which it is generating those profits. ROE is calculated by dividing the total profit by total amount of money invested in the company. \nThe return on assets (ROA) is a very useful indicator that illustrates how profitable a company really is in relation to its total assets. ROA is calculated by dividing the total annual earnings by the companys total assets.\n\nDividends and Price Earnings Ratio\nIntel Corporation has a dividend yield of 2.76%. The price/earnings ratio (P/E) is 14.86 and the forward P/E ratio stands at 14.7. The price to earnings growth is 1.8 and the price to sales growth is 2.97. \nThe price/earnings ratio (P/E) is one of the best known investment valuation indicators. P/E is calculated by dividing the trailing 12 months earnings per share by the present share price. Typically, a high P/E ratio means that the investors are paying more for todays earnings in hopes of future growth in earnings. \nThe forward price to earnings ratio, as the name suggests, is used to find the future price to earnings ratio. It is calculated by dividing the market price per share with the anticipated earnings per share.\nThe price to earnings growth ratio (PEG) is utilized for determining a stocks value in relation to the companys earnings. It helps to provide a more holistic picture with the P/E ratio. The PEG is calculated by dividing the price to earnings ratio by the annual earnings per share growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock is undervalued in relation to its earnings performance. \nVolume\nIntel Corporation has a 52-week low of 40.79% and 52-week high of -5.10%. The company has a 20-day simple moving average of 4.34% and a volume of 4.34%. The average volume stands around 27792.25.\nVolume is the amount of shares that trade hands  in simple terms. \nTechnical\nThe technical stats for Intel Corporation are as follows.\nIntel Corporation has a simple moving average of 4.34% over the last 20 days. The simple moving average for the last 200 days stands at 11.85%. Intel Corporation has a beta of 0.92 and the weekly and monthly volatility stands at 1.80% and 1.88% respectively. \nA simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of the stock for the given time periods, say for 20 days, and then dividing it by that time period- i.e 20. It usually helps to smooth out the noise by filtering out random price movements. Since SMA is based on past data, it will tend to have a lag. The longer the time period the greater the lag. So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. \nBeta is used to measure the volatility of the stock. A beta of less than 1 means that it is less volatile than the market and a beta of greater than 1 means that it is more volatile than the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock will move with the market.\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\nVolatility, in simple terms, is an indicator of how risky the stock is. It is the amount of uncertainty or riskabout the magnitude of changes in a stocks value. Higher volatility means that a stocks price can change radically in either direction in a very short period of time and lower volatility is just the opposite, as the price doesnt change dramatically  instead it varies at a steady pace over a significantly longer period of time. \n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and information expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any company stakeholders, financial professionals, or analysts.

S"\n                    Anyone that's followed me for any reasonable amount of time probably knows that shooting down Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquisition rumors is one of my favorite pastimes. Apple's massive net cash position of $150 billion inevitably invites non-stop acquisition speculation, so these ideas really do come up often enough for it to become a legitimate hobby.\nOn Thursday, FBR Capital analyst Daniel Ives suggested that Apple should acquire struggling action camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO). Ives suggests that GoPro would be a natural fit within Apple's current product portfolio of devices. And GoPro's forthcoming entry into drones seemingly makes sense for Apple as well, according to Ives. GoPro shares naturally jumped 11% following the report.\nNormally, I'd immediately brush this notion off like many others in the past, since GoPro doesn't fit the historical profile of an Apple acquisition target. The company's market cap is around $2.6 billion right now, and it doesn't possess any particularly innovative technology that Apple could potentially integrate into future products, and it has meaningful revenue streams of its own (Apple sometimes shutters acquired businesses after buying them since it just wants the talent or technology).\nBut there's one curve ball giving me pause this time around: Beats.\nApple just set a new precedent: buying a brandI don't believe that GoPro has particularly innovative technology that is proprietary to the company itself. GoPro became popular thanks to its rugged designs and professional-quality image processing technology (which comes from chip supplier Ambarella, not GoPro), and quickly became the dominant action camera brand for extreme sports enthusiasts and adventurers.\nThat has allowed GoPro to build something else entirely: a lifestyle brand. GoPro's rise wasn't attributable to particularly innovative camera technology, but rather the brand association and the subsequent breathtaking videos that tend to go viral (further reinforcing the brand).\nIt's also worth pointing out that Apple has exhibited some semblance of interest in the action camera market. The Mac maker was granted dozens of patents in January of this year, detailing a wearable action camera that can be mounted exactly like GoPro's offerings. That storyline partially set the negative tone for GoPro this year, as shares plunged on the competitive fears of Apple stepping in to challenge GoPro. But Apple patents stuff constantly and hardly ever pursues many of the ideas that it patents.\nA few years ago, I would have never thought that Apple would acquire a smaller company for its brand, since Apple already has the most valuable brand in the world. But then it bought Beats last year for $3 billion, its largest acquisition ever. There are three primary reasons why Apple made such a large and uncharacteristic acquisition: human curation technology and talent, Jimmy Iovine, and Beats' brand strength.\nThe fact that Apple bought a brand, something that would have been unthinkable two years ago, suggests that there is a tiny sliver of a possibility that Apple would acquire GoPro for its strong lifestyle brand.\nTime to wake upYet, the reality still remains that beyond GoPro's brand, there's little else that Apple could potentially want from GoPro. Apple didn'tjustbuy a brand in Beats, italsobought a brand in Beats. With Beats, Apple got some serious music industry talent with deep connections and technology that it would use to build Apple Music.\nWhat does GoPro have? A YouTube channel with 3.5 million subscribers and a quickly decelerating action camera business builtprimarilyaround brand strength. Apple already makes its own professional video-editing software too, so there's little reason for it to be interested in GoPro's software.\nThe action camera market is stalling right now, which is largely why GoPro is down 70% year to date. Besides, Apple isn't really interested in stand-alone products these days. It instead focuses on smart devices that accomplish a wide variety of tasks.\nAnd now we've come full circle. No, Apple won't buy GoPro.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.\n                    \n                "

S'\n                    Technology news website Fudzilla recently published an article claiming that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been "quietly working behind the scenes" to develop an in-house graphics processor for inclusion in future A-series processors.\nAlthough this might seem like news, particularly as it is well-known that Apple typically licenses graphics processors from graphics IP specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF), it\'s really not. There have been very clear and obvious signs in the public domain that Apple has been working on its own graphics processors for quite some time.\nJust look at Apple\'s job listings To illustrate my point, it\'s worth looking at Apple\'s recent job listings. If you go to Apple\'s job page and search for "GPU," a whole slew of job openings -- many of which are quite recent -- show up.\nNow, not all of these listings "prove" that Apple is working on a custom graphics processor, but there are ones like this that make it painfully obvious:\n\nData source: Apple.\nThis job listing shows that Apple needs engineers who can work to define the micro-architecture of a GPU and ultimately help to produce "high quality graphics [intellectual property] in order to meet performance, feature, timing, area, and power goals."\nIf the above job listing wasn\'t enough to convince you that Apple is working on custom graphics processors, it\'s also worth noting that it has poached a number of GPU industry veterans.\nFor example, back in March, Apple hired away John Tynefield from graphics giant NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). In his previous role, Tynefield was a senior director of GPU architecture responsible for many key parts of NVIDIA\'s GPU architectures.\nNow, he\'s a director of GPU architecture at Apple.\nApple also hired Utku Diril back in 2013. Diril came from graphics IP maker Vivante, where he was a director of architecture. At Apple, he worked on "GPU design and architecture" from Feb. 2013 through Nov. 2014 before moving on to the role of "ASIC design manager" (likely also working on helping to implement Apple GPU designs into system-on-chip designs).\nThere are countless other examples for those willing to spend some time looking at LinkedIn profiles.\nWhy is Apple working on a custom GPU? Apple has proven with its custom CPU designs that it can run quite a bit faster than its competition can and it is my opinion that Apple continues to put considerable distance between itself and other mobile CPU vendors (merchant or vertically integrated device makers) with its architectures.\nI suspect that Apple thinks that it can replicate the success that it has enjoyed in developing custom CPU architectures with GPUs.\nCan Apple pull it off? Probably Apple has no problems attracting many of the best and the brightest to join its ranks; from what I can tell, it has done a spectacular job of this on the CPU side.\nAs far as GPUs go, I think Apple has so far recruited quite a lot of excellent talent and should continue to do so in the coming years. Although it\'s not clear when exactly we should see Apple\'s first in-house graphics processors, I believe that when we do see them, they will prove to be industry leading, just like its CPUs and overall system-on-chip designs are today.\nThis $19 trillion industry could destroy the InternetOne bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. It could make early investors wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism... The Economist is calling it "transformative"... But you\'ll probably just call it "how I made my millions." Don\'t be too late to the party -- click here for one stock to own when the Web goes dark.\n                    \n                '

But that doesnt mean it cant regularly nudge and remind them that theres a new shiny smartphone available every chance they get  even when theyre just visiting the App Store on their device.\nSeveral iPhone users this week spotted iPhone 6S pop-up advertising that began appearing when they browsed the App Store through an iPhone 5S or earlier device. The ads, which tout Apples smartphone as ridiculously powerful, nudge users to learn more about the device and give them an opportunity to upgrade right on the spot. It appears that Apple has started the ad campaign across older devices in several countries, with several Twitter users posting the screenshots of the ad in different languages on Twitter.\nNow when you open apps like App Store on iPhone 5S and below, you get presented with this ad for iPhone 6S pic.twitter.com/3KDwyaCils\n\t&mdash; Andrew Hart (@AndrewProjDent) December 11, 2015\nJ&#39;ai eu cette image en ouvrant l&#39;App Store sur mon iPhone 5... pic.twitter.com/zASyUQ2GL0\n\t&mdash; Pierre Dandumont (@DandumontP) December 11, 2015\nIts not uncommon for Apple to cross promote its products through banners and other images on its digital properties. But this time around, customers have to hit the skip button to get back to their activities  much like the advertisements seen on some online publications or in third-party apps.\n\nOne reason for Apple to do this is theall-important holiday quarter where investors are looking to see if the iPhone juggernaut can out-do last years record-breaking quarter of 74.5 million iPhones sold. This time around, Wall Street consensus estimates project iPhone sales will reach 78 million in the December quarter. Thats despite a global smartphone market that is expected to slow its growth in shipments to 9.8 percent by the end of the year, down from 27.6 percent in 2014, according to IDC.\n      \n    "

S'\n                    This year has been a pretty busy one for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), busier than most years in recent memories in terms of product introductions. Most years see a new iPhone, a new iPad, and a handful of spec bumps and refreshes throughout the rest of its product portfolio. But 2015 has seen quite a few major new products and services.\nHere are the most meaningful:\n\nApple Watch: This is a big one. As Apple\'s first smartwatch and wearable device, Apple Watch represents the first new product category that Apple has entered since the iPad in 2010.\nMacBook: The 12-inch MacBook with Retina display had been circulating in the rumor mill for many months, and the brand-new device has been somewhat controversial for a variety of reasons.\niPhone 6s and 6s Plus: Continuing the expected tick-tock cycle, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus added 3D Touch this year as the headline-selling feature while keeping the same overall design.\niPad Pro: Like the MacBook, there had been plenty of leaks about a larger 12.9-inch iPad in the works that would enhance productivity.\nApple Pencil: After resisting the stylus trend, Apple has now jumped on the bandwagon in order to enhance the iPad Pro\'s appeal to creative professionals.\niPad mini 4: Last year, the iPad mini 3 was a very modest upgrade, but this year represents a better performance increase.\nApple Music: Apple\'s on-demand music streaming service is a little bit late to the game, but it offers the music industry better economics since there is no ad-supported free version.\nApple TV: It had been several years since the streaming media box had seen any updates, and Apple delivered a big one with a new interface combined with the new Siri Remote.\n\nHow do we pick which one of these is most important?\nWinner: MacBookI believe the new 12-inch MacBook is the best new Apple product of 2015. Here\'s why.\n\nImage source: Apple.\nNever mind the fact that the new MacBook uses a low-power processor that technically offers less power than other MacBooks. Never mind the controversial decision to only include a single USB-C port (other than the headphone jack) for power, charging, data transfer, and external displays. Never mind the high price of admission, charging $1,299 for the cheapest configuration.\nBuying the 12-inch MacBook comes with plenty of compromises. It doesn\'t handle CPU-intensive tasks very well, you need a wide variety of dongles to properly use USB-C port since there aren\'t many accessories yet, and it\'s expensive. Beyond the product itself, it\'s more about what the MacBook represents.\n\nImage source: Apple.\n\nThe new MacBook shows that Apple is still the same forward-looking and innovative company. If anything, the MacBook is ahead of its time. Nearly all of the reviews say that it\'s as if the device is from the future. Indeed, Apple\'s official marketing tag line for it is: "Light. Years ahead." And it\'s quite fitting. In a recent interview with Mashable discussing the new MacBook, marketing chief Phil Schiller described Apple\'s philosophy: "We found that the best thing we could do is push boundaries beyond what\'s expected, beyond what\'s comfortable sometimes."\nIf all of the criticisms sound eerily familiar, it\'s because they echo the same criticisms of the original MacBook Air from 2008, which launched at an even higher $1,799 initially. But following the 2010 refresh, the MacBook Air would then go on to set the standard for consumer laptops for the next half-decade. Nearly all laptops were judged against the Air once the industry caught up to the original vision of an ultra-portable laptop. It even inspired a new class of PC laptops called Ultrabooks: thin, light, and powerful laptops at premium price points.\nThe MacBook won\'t drive as much revenue as the iPhone, expand an addressable market like the iPad Pro, or enter an entirely new product category like Apple Watch. But the MacBook shows that Apple is comfortable making consumers a little uncomfortable if it\'s all in the name of progress.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) followerHorace Dediu expects watch shipments to hit 21m units in its first full year of sales, and this will generate revenue worth $8.4bn for the firm. Dediu told this while speaking at the first-ever Glance conference.\n\nGrowing popular for various reasons\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt of Fortune, who attended the event as a reporter and panelist, said that Dediu calculated an ASP of $400 for the watch over its first 12 months of availability. Apple Watch Sports models with a starting price of $349 or $399 depending on size, were found to be the most popular (no surprises in this).\nAnother analyst, Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies, expect Apple to move well-over 100m watch units by 2017. Bajarin estimates are based on the current trends.

The earnings per share growth over the next five years will be . NVIDIA Corporation had an earnings per share growth of 62.50% in the last 5 years.\nCurrently the return on equity is 13.60% and its debt to equity is 0.32. NVIDIA Corporation has a total market cap of $ 17743.24, a gross margin of 56.00% while the profit margin is 12.30% and the ROI is 10.90% \n\nPerformance\nThe stats on NVIDIA Corporation are currently as follows.\nThe weekly performance is 1.70%, and the quarterly performance is at 46.16%. The monthly performance is 7.45% and the yearly performance is 65.40%. The performance for Year to Date (YTD) is 67.22%.\nNVIDIA Corporation has earnings per share of $ 1.07 and the earnings per share growth for this year is 51.40%. The ROI is 10.90% and the return on equity for NVIDIA Corporationas stated earlier, is currently at 13.60%.The return on assets (ROA) for NVIDIA Corporation is 8.40%. \nThe earnings per share (EPS) is a direct measure of a companys profit. EPS is calculated by subtracting dividends from profits and dividing it by the total number of shares outstanding.\nThe return on investment (ROI) is the money a company has made or lost on an investment  in simple terms. \nThe return on equity (ROE) measures the companys profitability and the efficiency at which it is generating those profits. ROE is calculated by dividing the total profit by total amount of money invested in the company. \nThe return on assets (ROA) is a very useful indicator that illustrates how profitable a company really is in relation to its total assets. ROA is calculated by dividing the total annual earnings by the companys total assets.\n\nDividends and Price Earnings Ratio\nNVIDIA Corporation has a dividend yield of 1.39%. The price/earnings ratio (P/E) is 30.82 and the forward P/E ratio stands at 24.39. The price to earnings growth is 7.06 and the price to sales growth is 3.65. \nThe price/earnings ratio (P/E) is one of the best known investment valuation indicators. P/E is calculated by dividing the trailing 12 months earnings per share by the present share price. Typically, a high P/E ratio means that the investors are paying more for todays earnings in hopes of future growth in earnings. \nThe forward price to earnings ratio, as the name suggests, is used to find the future price to earnings ratio. It is calculated by dividing the market price per share with the anticipated earnings per share.\nThe price to earnings growth ratio (PEG) is utilized for determining a stocks value in relation to the companys earnings. It helps to provide a more holistic picture with the P/E ratio. The PEG is calculated by dividing the price to earnings ratio by the annual earnings per share growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock is undervalued in relation to its earnings performance. \nVolume\nNVIDIA Corporation has a 52-week low of 77.02% and 52-week high of -2.45%. The company has a 20-day simple moving average of 13.31% and a volume of 13.31%. The average volume stands around 8754.15.\nVolume is the amount of shares that trade hands  in simple terms. \nTechnical\nThe technical stats for NVIDIA Corporation are as follows.\nNVIDIA Corporation has a simple moving average of 13.31% over the last 20 days. The simple moving average for the last 200 days stands at 40.64%. NVIDIA Corporation has a beta of 1.32 and the weekly and monthly volatility stands at 3.17% and 2.30% respectively. \nA simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of the stock for the given time periods, say for 20 days, and then dividing it by that time period- i.e 20. It usually helps to smooth out the noise by filtering out random price movements. Since SMA is based on past data, it will tend to have a lag. The longer the time period the greater the lag. So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. \nBeta is used to measure the volatility of the stock. A beta of less than 1 means that it is less volatile than the market and a beta of greater than 1 means that it is more volatile than the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock will move with the market.\n.gadsense_slot_1{ display: inline-block; width: 300px; height: 250px;}\n@media (min-width:500px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } }\n@media (min-width:768px) { .gadsense_slot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } }\n\n \n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); \n\nVolatility, in simple terms, is an indicator of how risky the stock is. It is the amount of uncertainty or riskabout the magnitude of changes in a stocks value. Higher volatility means that a stocks price can change radically in either direction in a very short period of time and lower volatility is just the opposite, as the price doesnt change dramatically  instead it varies at a steady pace over a significantly longer period of time. \n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and information expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any company stakeholders, financial professionals, or analysts.

S'\n                    Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently introduced new enterprise phone and conferencing features to Office 365 to widen its moat against business communication rivals Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).\n\nSource: Microsoft.\nDeeper Skype integration plays a centralrole in this push. Skype Meeting Broadcast lets users broadcast a Skype for Business meeting to up to 10,000 people. Attendees can access the meeting on a mobile device or a desktop browser. Yammer powers the platform\'s chat capabilities, while Bing Pulse supports its real-time voting capabilities. \nFor users who lack a stable Internet connection, Cloud PBX and PSTN Conferencing let users make and receive phone calls from mobile phones and landlines. Microsoft is also offering a new bundle called Office 365 E5, which packages Skype for Business with cloud-based security and analytics services.\nHow will this help Microsoft?Microsoft estimates that over 50% of enterprises pay for independent conferencing solutions. By bundling communications, security, and analytics together with Office 365 subscriptions, Microsoft is shoring up its defenses against cloud-based productivity suites like Google Apps for Work and rival communications platforms like Cisco\'s WebEx.\nMicrosoft is adding unlimited conferencing with analytics and security features to the Office-Skype bundle for $35 per month, while international calling plans cost $24 extra. Cheaper packages with fewer features cost $8 to $20 per month. Wainhouse Research analyst Bill Haskins told The Wall Street Journal that these prices would be "pretty disruptive" to competing platforms with fewer features.\nThe global enterprise telephony and unified communications (UC) market generally isn\'t considered a strong growth market. According to IHS Infonetics, total spending in the sector fell 4% annually last year to $8.7 billion. However, that slump masked 20% growth in the smaller UC applications segment, which consists of "unified" communications solutions like Microsoft\'s Office-Skype bundle. Back in June, IHS reported that while Cisco and Avaya were the top enterprise telephony vendors,Microsoft dominated the UC market thanks to Windows\' massive enterprise presence.\n\nSkype. Source: Microsoft.\nA $50 billion opportunityMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella believes that adding new telephony, security, and cloud-based analytics features to Office 365 will expand theplatform\'s long-term market opportunity "by more than $50 billion." Last quarter, Microsoft added 3 million new Office 365 consumer subscribers for a total of 18.2 million users. It reported that Office commercial products and cloud services revenue rose 5% on a constant currency basis, while Office 365 commercial revenue surged 70% on the same basis.\nBack in April, Nadella declared that Microsoft could generate $20 billion in annual cloud revenues by 2018, which is more than double its current run rate of $8.2 billion. Most of Microsoft\'s cloud revenues are generated by SaaS platforms like Office 365, Dynamics CRM, and Skype. Azure, its higher-growth PaaS/IaaS platform, accounts for less thana fifth of that total, according to Forrester Research. \nBy deepening ties between Office 365 and analytics and security services that run on Azure, Microsoft strengthens all of its cloud platforms. All those cloud services could then support the growth of Windows 10, which pulls together all those SaaS features. Simply put, bundling all those features together locks enterprise customers into Microsoft\'s ecosystem and keeps rivals at bay.\nWhat does this mean for Cisco and Google?Like Microsoft, Cisco uses bundling strategies to strengthen its enterprise presence. But instead of productivity software, Cisco bundles networking hardware with various security and communications services. Last quarter, security revenuerose 7% and WebEx revenue surged 23%. However, these businesses only generate a small percentage of Cisco\'s overall revenue, which still comes from sales of routers and switches. Microsoft\'s aggressive advance into the UC market is troubling for Cisco because it reduces the need for Cisco\'s telephony solutions and security services.\nMeanwhile, Google has been losing ground to Microsoft in the cloud enterprise app market. Last year, it controlled 16.3% of that market while Microsoft claimed just 7.7%. But in August, cloud security firm Bitglass reported that the tables had turned, with Microsoft claiming 25.2% of the market and beating Google\'s 22.8%. That sudden comeback indicated that more noncloud Office business users were finally upgrading to Office 365. Bundling more lucrative features with Office 365 can help Microsoft extend that lead.\nThe key takeawayMicrosoft\'s introduction of new Office-Skype features might seem like a routine upgrade, but it also indicates that the tech giant plans to defend its enterprise turf against UC and enterprise app rivals like Cisco and Alphabet. By bundling additional services into Office 365, Microsoft can gain more users, widen its defensive moat, and cast a halo effect across all its main cloud platforms.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.'

S'\n                           Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made great strides yesterday as it topped major rivals, including Intel Corporation, Alphabet Inc., and Qualcomm Inc. in the sixth annual ImageNet image recognition contest. The competition encourages developers to design the best system for identification of objects in pictures or videos, without any human assistance. By attaining the first position, Microsoft has just strengthened its position as a pioneer of modern technology.\nMicrosofts system, dubbed Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition, displayed the highest level among all its rivals, and even exceeded human capabilities in a few tests. The advanced machine learning tool used by the tech giant uses deep neural networks, which enables the system to accurately identify images. Neural nets are essentially computer programs that mimic the human brains biological processing, to establish connections between data points and facilitate continuous learning.\nNormally, neural nets with 20 to 30 layers are considered very well for machine learning, but the Windows-maker went way beyond that: by deploying 152 layers, it used a five times more powerful system for image recognition. The company itself was shocked at its achievement. Principal Research Manager Jian Sun said: We even didnt believe this single idea could be so significant.\nThe team ranked first in all three competition categories it entered; classification, localization, and detection. The contest required entrants to distinguish objects from over 100,000 pictures found on search engines and Flickr, and categorize them into 1,000 sections. Microsofts error rate at 3.5% for classification and 9% for localization helped it achieve a high-margin win over all other entries.\nAlthough Microsoft topped the contest, other tech giants arent that far behind in machine learning. Last month Google open sourced its TensorFlow machine learning library, while earlier this year Facebook Inc. released its deep-learning tool Torch. Open source codes provide external developers the opportunity to improve these platforms using their expertise. Apple Inc. remains the sole tech giant following a discrete approach over its machine learning program, with some experts holding the belief that this harms overall development of the artificial intelligence industry, in the long run.\nThe ImageNet competition is serving as a breakthrough for the advancement of machine learning technology. Owing to high inaccuracies, previous systems have been relatively unreliable. Microsofts team has developed better understanding of how deep neural networks operate, and has vastly improved its removal of anomalies. The same technology is currently being used for many everyday applications, such as real- time language translations through Skype Translator. We can expect greater tools in the near future, as developers create even more efficient machine learning programs.                        '

S'\n                    Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) just capped an excellent fiscal 2015 in its ongoing transition to a subscription-based software model. But similar to its quarterly report three months ago, the creative software provider offered lighter-than-expected guidance for the coming year. But before we get there, let\'s take a closer look at what Adobe accomplished in its latest quarter.\nAdobe Systems results: The raw numbers\n\n\nMetric\nFiscal Q4 2015 Actuals\n\nFiscal Q4 2014 Actuals\n\nGrowth (YOY)\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\n$1.31 billion\n\n\n$1.07 billion\n\n\n21.7%\n\n\n\n\nGAAP net income\n\n\n$222.7 million\n\n\n$88.1 million\n\n\n152.8%\n\n\n\n\nGAAP earnings per share (diluted)\n\n\n$0.44\n\n\n$0.17\n\n\n158.8%\n\n\n\n\nData source: Adobe Systems Incorporated.\nWhat happened with Adobe Systems this quarter?\n\nExcluding one-time items, adjusted net income rose 59.4% year over year to $311.9 million, or $0.62 per diluted share.\nBoth Adobe\'s top and bottom lines came in at the high end of "light"guidance provided in September, which called for revenue of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion, and adjusted EPS of $0.56 to $0.62.\nDigital media annualized recurring revenue increased $350 million to $2.99 billion exiting the quarter, including a $310 million increase in creative ARR to $2.6 billion.\nAdded 833,000 net new Creative Cloud subscriptions (accelerating from 684,000 last quarter), leaving Adobe with a total of 6.17 million.\nAdobe Marketing Cloud revenue was $352 million, reached 30% annual bookings growth for the year, and enjoyed a "stronger-than-expected shift in customer adoption to SaaS-based solutions."\nCash flow from operations was $455 million.\nDeferred revenue increased to a company-record $1.49 billion, up from $1.31 billion last quarter.\nAdobe repurchased 1.4 million shares for $122 million, bringing total repurchases for the fiscal year to 8.1 million shares for $627 million.\n\nWhat management had to sayAdobe CEO Shantanu Narayen stated, "Adobe is driving digital experiences that are fundamental to the transformation of every global brand, government and educational institution. Our record revenue and strong momentum are a reflection of our industry-leading content and data solutions in Digital Media and Digital Marketing."\nCFO Mark Garrett also reminded investors of their financial goals, laid out at the company\'s annual meeting in October: "Our long-term financial targets, including a 20% revenue CAGR through fiscal 2018, show that the benefits of our move to the cloud are just beginning."\nLooking forwardIn the meantime, during the subsequent conference call Garrett told investors to expect continued momentum as Adobe heads into its new fiscal year. As such, Adobe is increasing its net new digital media ARR growth target to roughly $1 billion this year (up from $738 million previously), bringing its total target for digital media ARR in fiscal 2016 to $3.875 billion.\nAdditionally, Adobe anticipates revenue and earnings per share to grow sequentially for each quarter during the year, including sequential growth from fiscal Q4 2015 to the current quarter in both Creative and Marketing Cloud. As a result, Adobe is targeting fiscal first-quarter 2016 revenue of $1.30 billion to $1.35 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $0.33 to $0.39, and adjusted EPS of $0.56 to $0.62. For perspective, Wall Street\'s consensus estimates predicted roughly the same revenue would result in adjusted earnings per share near the high end of Adobe\'s expected range.\nBut even putting aside Adobe\'s propensity for under-promising and over-delivering, that shouldn\'t be terribly concerning given Adobe\'s ambitious share repurchase efforts. More than anything, I think this quarter represented another impressive performance from Adobe, as it continues to demonstrateaccelerating momentum in its transition to the cloud.\nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world\'s biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn\'t miss a beat: There\'s a small company that\'s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here.\n                    \n                '

S'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be having problems with sales of the iPhone 6S, but the firm has a solution to those problems. Each day brings the iPhone 7 release date, though still mysterious, a day closer, and weve heard lots of rumors about the iPhone 7 specs in the last couple of weeks.\n\nLots of people, still stuck with a two year cell contract, will be waiting for the next Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone to hit before upgrading. Likewise a lot of people may have been disappointed with the feature set offered on the iPhone 6S and may want to hold out for the next device from Apple. Heres a look at what that rectangle might offer.\nApple Inc. iPhone 7 specs get slightly clearer\nWeve had a couple of stories this week that support some rumors about the iPhone 7 specs. The first, and likely the most important, came direct from Apple itself. In a surprise move earlier this week the Cupertino firm releases the $99 Smart Battery case. The device just about doubles the life of the iPhone 6S, and it shows what Apples plans for the iPhone 7 specs might be.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)likely didnt release the case without thinking about the iPhone 7 design, and it implies that battery life in the next phone will be just about the same as that in the iPhone 6S. It may require a case to get power users the battery life that they crave, but its going to be very very thing.\nMing Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, the most reliable voice out there when it comes to iPhone 7 specs rumors, says that the next phone from Cupertino is going to be between 6 and 6.5mm thick. Thats significantly down from the 7.1mm of the iPhone 6S.\nAnother rumor that broke this week supports that idea even more fully. Apple has apparently moved all of its orders for the A10 chipset that will drive the iPhone 7 away from Samsung. Apple has chosen TSMC to make the A10 chip because the firm has been able to put together a smaller form factor.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...  Apple Inc. (AAPL) Indian Assault Takes A New, Humble ShapeWhat else is going to be on the iPhone 7 specs sheet? At this point we really dont know too much about the next Apple device. We know were in for a major redesign this time around, but rumors that the Home button are on the way out seem a little far-fetched.\nStories that the iPhone 7 specs will include lots of waterproofing features seem a little more believable, but theyre not likely to be the biggest selling point for a new smartphone. The idea that Apple will get rid of the headphone port in the iPhone 7 to make the device thinner seems like something Cupertino could be considering, but the rumors about that change arent exactly backed by credible sources.\nWeve also heard that the iPhone 7 specs will include higher RAM, a better camera, and an edge-to-edge screen. Until some of these stories begin to be supported by sources with decent credibility its very hard to say how the iPhone 7 will actually be formed. Were going to have to wait until Mr. Kuo finds out and puts the info out there.\nFor now the iPhone 7 specs rumors are fuzzy, but well be expecting to see a lot more leaks from the supply chain in the early part of next year. What is clear, however, is that this time around iPhone 7 rumors might matter for more than just those buying a new smartphone. Wall Street may e more focused on the device this time around as investors worry about sales of the current Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) phone, and the future of the firm as a whole.\niPhone 7 release date is creeping closer\nWe know that Apple will release a new iPhone next year, and we can make a pretty good guess about when the iPhone 7 release date will fall. Apple has stuck to a September release date for the last number of years, and it seems that theres little reason to change that in 2016.\nThere are, as happens before the release date of many iPhones is announced, rumors that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)will decide to put the iPhone 7 release date a few months early. This kind of story is usually driven by stories of low sales growth in the firms smartphone division.\n .IRPP_minimalist { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:#eaeaea; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid #34495E!important; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -o-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17); text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist:active, .IRPP_minimalist:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .IRPP_minimalist { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .IRPP_minimalist .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist .postTitle { color:#000000; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .IRPP_minimalist:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } Related Story ...  BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) PRIV Will Heal Wounds in 2016Indeed there are lots of stories and forecasts out there that suggest Apple is going to have a bad time this holiday quarter, at least in terms of smart phone sales. In the three months through December 2104 the firm sold 74.5M smartphones. IDC thinks that Apple may sell fewer than 70M units this year.\nThat would represent the first major slow down in sales since Apple put the iPhone on the market back in 2007. For that reason iPhone 7 specs and release date rumors matter more than ever this time around.\nIf people around the world believe that Apple is going to update its smartphone early on in 2016, theyre more likely to forego the firms current device. Likewise if iPhone 7 specs rumors imply a massive change next year feature hungry buyers are likely to wait rather than spend $700 on a phone thats going to be outclassed in just a few months.\nApple Insider, paraphrasing a source it regards as reliable, says that Apple is looking at an iPhone 7 release date thats earlier than September. If thats true, and it seems much more likely to be false, then there may be some effect on demand for the firms current phone.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)stock is in a delicate position right now, and that seems mostly down to forecasts that the current iPhone isnt going to be quite as hot of a seller as last years device.\nAny rumors that might shift demand from this year to next year could have the net result of hurting the shareswhich arealready ina fragile state. Apple stock is up by more than 2 percent since the start of the year, but in the last six months its lost about 12 percent of its value. iPhone 7 specs and release date rumors matter more than ever this time around, and those holding Apple stock should be aware of the shifts, though sources with less credibility should, of course, be discounted.\n\njQuery.ajax({url: "http://learnbonds.com/", data: {top_ten_id: 125625, top_ten_blog_id: 1, activate_counter: 11, top10_rnd: (new Date()).getTime() + "-" + Math.floor(Math.random()*100000)}});'

S'\n                           2016 will be a rather interesting year for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company is expected to release a slew of products to entice customers once again next year. The possible products to be launched may include new iPhones, a new Apple TV, Apple Watch 2.0 and more. Bidness Etc explores the most likely releases from the company, for next year.\nThe iPhone 6c (4-inch)\nApple knows that there is now a small niche that holds the iPhone 5s close to their hearts. The launch of the iPhone 6 left a gap in the product portfolio as there was no upgrade to the iPhone 5s. After the launch of the 6s last September, rumors popped up about a 4-inch variant to help the iPhone line stay relevant. Recent rumors have pegged the device to be launched in early 2016; January or March. The device is expected to sport an A9 processor, new aluminum body but will not have 3D Touch, which should keep its price in the mid-range category.\n\n"Apple plans March Apple Watch 2 event, 4-inch \'iPhone 6c\' possible https://t.co/UdcpB2Oqy4 pic.twitter.com/wBZ7ycaQrj"  Mark Gurman (@markgurman) December 8, 2015\n\n\n"We may not know how big this small niche is but users on online communities are looking forward to this new phone. Some are skeptical; the 4-inch iPhone 5c when launched was considered a flop. Further rumors are speculating that the new device may have an aluminum body with different color options as well as Touch ID to make it eligible for Apple Pay. Of course the 4-inch iPhone will have Apple Pay. Why would Apple launch another iPhone without it?"  Mark Gurman (@markgurman) December 4, 2015\n\nIn case Apple announces the phone in March, the company will have that month to start a new product cycle and subsequently, earn more money from the upgraded category.\nApple Watch 2.0\nApple released the Apple Watch in April amidst a container full of rumors. The watch received a lukewarm reception after which Apple decided to keep the sales figures for the device a secret. At the companys recent earnings, the Apple Watch was still merged in with the Others category where the Apple TV and other accessories reside. Recent rumors have speculated that Apple may sell 21 million units of the Apple Watch by March 2016. As the product cycle completes, Apple could be poised to refresh the variant with new versions.\nThe Apple Watch 2.0 has been rumored to fix all the previous complaints with its predecessor. There is a possibility that the company will add a better battery, powerful processor and possibly a new camera. Whatever the case, the Apple Watch 2.0 will be one of the most-awaited products of the year.\niPhone 7\nOne of the most exciting products to come out of Cupertino in 2016 will be the launch of the next-generation iPhone 7. The rumor mill is churning out fresh conjectures every now and then. Patent reports also point to some new features that could be added to the product. One patent by the company hints at the possibility of a water-proof phone while the another signals a wireless charging-enabled phone.\nAnother patent by Apple also looked at the possibility of removing the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of a lightening enabled headphone. The rumor caused quite a stir as users back their faith in the traditional headphone jack. This would mean that accessory makers, headphone enthusiasts and other companies will have to change their entire product line to go in line with Apples. The removal of the obsolete yet useful 3.5mm jack will help Apple trim off another 1mm from the iPhones body. The companys race to make the thinnest phone in the world may not be that far as TSMC also announced a new chip packing process. This will allow the logic boards for the chips to be fit in a more compact and small space, so Apple can trim some more millimeters off the iPhone.\nWhatever the case, 2016 is going to be an exciting year for Apple. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster appeared on CNBC a few days ago where he talked about how the 4-inch iPhone, the Apple Watch and the iPhone7 will help Apple achieve a good year. Moreover, the upgrade program by the company will spice things up as Apple will allow users to upgrade in 15 months, rather than the carrier set 22 months. We wait to see how the new year is for Apple.                        '

S'\n                           In an apology offered to its customers, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced yesterday that it will revert back to its 15GB free cloud storage policy. The tech giant shocked many consumers in November, when it announced plans to reduce its OneDrive free storage limit to 5GB whilst scrapping the unlimited storage option. This prompted over 72,000 angry complaints on OneDrives feedback portal, which has now forced the company to backtrack its decision.\nThe company had originally blamed its decision to reduce storage cap on consumers who took unfair advantage and uploaded huge data storage volumes for free. This resulted in a backlash from customers on OneDrives forum who questioned why other users should suffer due to actions of a few.\nMicrosoft group program manager, Douglas Pearce wrote in a blog post: We are all genuinely sorry for the frustration this decision has caused and for the way it was communicated. Thank you for sticking with us.\nThough the Windows-maker is not eliminating plans to end unlimited storage package, it will now continue to allow OneDrive subscribers to use the 15GB free storage. A bonus 15GB camera roll is also included, thereby increasing total free storage to 30GB.\nThis reversion to old limits however, will not be an automatic process. Users have the option of subscribing to this package for free until January 31, 2016. For users unaware of these changed policies, their storage cap will reduce to 5GB if they do not opt-in by the aforementioned date.\nAs a further incentive, the tech giant has offered one year subscription to Office 365 Personal for OneDrive users, opting to use more than 5GB storage package. Existing 365 users will have their storage capped at one terabyte. But for those who exceeded this limit and used the unlimited package prior to change in policies, there would be no excess storage charges for next 12 months.\nThe most important highlight from this whole ordeal is how well Microsoft responded to negative customer feedback. Despite a time duration of one whole month taken to issue a response, it is evident that the company listens to, and values the interests of its consumers. Both OneDrive and Office 365 users now have one year to plan, which storage package is best for their use as per Microsofts amended policies.                        '

The Band was launched recently, but Microsoft has already incorporated customer feedback through its software update. The update includes new music controls, a much-improved Exercise Tile, and activity reminders.\nMicrosoft introuced the new music controls on its official blog. The company detailed how users do not need their smartphones to control the music, with the Bands full-color touchscreen illustrating the name of the song currently being played. Users pause and play songs right from the Band, while the option to skip songs back and forward was also added. Users can control the volume from the Band as well.\nMicrosoft has also teamed up with Spotify to allow users to connect music apps on the users' smartphone to their Microsoft Band via Bluetooth. Microsoft did tell users that any music app can connect to the Band as well, and allow users to adjust the Bands music controls at all times.\nMicrosoft has also added notifications to the mix to remind users to be more active  namely, notifications to get up and move. Users with a sedentary lifestyle will now get a reminder to move around a bit when they have been sitting for too long. Users themselves can set the days and the time intervals when they want to be reminded, and can set days when they do not want to be reminded. This is useful for users working in an office setting who want to be reminded to move during the week, but may not necessarily want to be bothered on a lazy Sunday afternoon.\nThe improved Exercise Tile allows users to pick their favorite activity, with options such as weightlifting or yoga. Users can even name their own exercise (an option I, for one, will find very useful). Users can then track the heart rate, duration, and calories burned during the exercise, and then view the stats in the Web Dashboard or the Microsoft Health app. The health stats will be grouped together along with the particular exercise type chosen by the user, allowing for a more accurate comparison regarding exertions based on different activities.\nUsers can also learn about these features through the Whats New Tile added to the Band. The tile will be used to inform users about new updates. Microsoft apparently plans to release consistent updates for the Microsoft Band, given that itwould recently add an on-screen keyboard to enable messaging functionality.\nInactivity alerts and music controls show how the Band is positioned as a fitness tracker as well as a basic smartwatch. At around $249, the Band is certainly offering good value for money and the compatibility with most music apps is a feature, which can help widespread adoptability of the Microsoft wearable. Along with its sleek design, the Band is fast becoming a wearable to consider for many.                        "
