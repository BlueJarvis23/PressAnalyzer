          <p>This project is an attempt to correlate the sentiment of an arbitrary article about a company to stock trends of that company. Work done on this project is intended at be a proof of concept that can confirm or contradict the validity of such a correlation.</p>

<p>The following image shows the basic results and output of the Press Analyzer. It shows that on November 11, 2015 the Press Analyzer gave very positive scores to articles about Apple and Nvidia. By examining the market for these two companies this day we can see that the stock did indeed increase.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlueJarvis23/PressAnalyzer/master/screen_shots/teaser.png" alt="Teaser"></p>

<p>Lets dive in and talk about how the Press Analyzer works.</p>

<h3>
<a id="project-overview" class="anchor" href="#project-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Overview</h3>

<p>I am interested in using AI to follow trends of data, specifically, the trends of the stock market. I believe that a less common approach to this problem is to try and model the stimulants of the stock market instead of past data trends. My vision for this project is to use AI techniques to determine market reactions to company's press releases and articles such as product reviews. For example, it is not uncommon to have the stock market react in a volatile fashion after a company reports it’s quarterly earnings. Sometimes the press release that is positive for one company will also affect a competitors company in a negative fashion. For example if a company comes out with a new product that outperforms the current trend-setter their stock will rise but their competitor’s stock will drop even if the press release does not mention the competitor by name. I would like to create a system that can look for these subtle connections and, if possible, correctly predict stock market trends.</p>

<p>In thinking about creating this press release analyzer I tried to break it down into a manageable initial task. Initially, I believe it will be important to determine the tone of a particular article, ex. Is the article positive or negative? This is the current topic of this project. If the correlation of article sentiment and stocks can be shown to be plausible then connections between companies can be added at a later time.</p>

<h3>
<a id="project-purpose" class="anchor" href="#project-purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Purpose</h3>

<p>Hopefully throughout the course of this project a positive correlation can be shown. This could be the basis of further research and development of new systems to analyze and predict stocks. Preliminary tests indicate that given sufficient training samples that  the system is able to predict sentiment of articles with higher accuracy. Because the accuracy is being measured using stock market averages the initial results appear to be quite promising.</p>

<h3>
<a id="method" class="anchor" href="#method" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Method</h3>

<p>To create the Press Analyzer I made use of the Natural Language Toolkit (<a href="http://www.nltk.org">NLTK</a>) python library. This library provides many tools to analyze the english langauge to determine the sentiment behind speech. I made use of code provided by Andy Bromberg at <a href="http://andybromberg.com/sentiment-analysis-python/">http://andybromberg.com/sentiment-analysis-python/</a>. Andy's method for determining sentiment behind text was to use a Naive Bayes Filter which is similar to an email spam filter that he trained with an inital training set with predetermined sentiment. These training articles were split into two sets, one for positive and one for negative text. The filter is then trained with the training set and then new articles can be shown to the filter and it would determine if they were positive or negative in nature.</p>

<p>I used this idea and did something simalar. I downloaded 6 months on <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/">official press releases from Apple</a>. Next I pulled stock data using a Google Finance API along with Pandas to check what happened on the day the article was release. I then grouped these articles into two sets. One for articles when the market went up and one where the market went down. After splitting these press releases into two sets I used Andy's code to create a filter trained with my training set.</p>

<p>After creating this training set I then used the RSS feeds hosted by google on their Google Finance page to gather articles about specific companies. I then ran each of these articles through my filter to determine their sentiment. Using this sentiment I create a score for each of the companies that I am analyzing. The more positive the score the greater the likelyhood that then market will react possitively toward that company. Currently I am gathering information on 10 technology companies. My thinking here is that the language used to talk about Apple will be similar to other technology companies. These 10 Companies are: Apple, Micron Technology Inc., Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Oracle, Adobe, and Texas Instuments.</p>

<p>After making my prediction about an article's sentiment I then save it for later verification. After 5 days I look back at the articles and see what the 5 day average was on either side of the article's release date was. I then determine whether the article was release on a day that corresponded with a rise or a drop in the stocks for that company. The last step that I do is then place this article into the correct training set so that it can be used to re-train my filter. In this was my system should get better over time at determining the sentament of articles as they relate to stocks.</p>

<h3>
<a id="results" class="anchor" href="#results" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Results</h3>

<p>I have not had enough runtime to show improvement in the prediction. This is because of the limited number of articles that I can pull per day. Some companies, like Apple, are very active on the web and there are a lot of articles talking about them and other companies are more obscure. The other problem that complicates the problem of pulling multiple articles is that each website has the content layed out differently. This make scraping the content of the websites a pain. I need to find a better way to do this because at present I have to manually program the scraper so that it can pull the content from a website. Luckily the wesites that are the most active seem to be active across many companies.</p>

<p>There are three very interesting correlations that I have discovered while creating this project. Unsuprisingly the first is that if I can scrape a large quantity of articles about a single company on a single day then the Press Analyzer is more likely to predict the correct outcome. This is especially apparent in examineing the data about Apple. I have about 5.4 articles release about Apple per day. This is also helped because my initial training data was with official Apple press releases. With these two factors combined I am predicting just over 70% correctly for Apple. I am interested to see how these numbers change as the filter continues to improve.</p>

<p>The second observation that I made about the Press Analyzer is that it is better at predicting the opening vs closing relationship for stocks than it is as predicting the overall state of the market. In other words the Press Analyzer predicts whether stock on a particular day will go up but not if the market will trend up and down. I believe that this is because I don't measure increases and drops in stocks releative to an index. This means that even if the article indicates a favorable increase for a company the stock market may go down because of other pressures on the market.</p>

<p>The third interesting discovery can be seen in the graph below.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlueJarvis23/PressAnalyzer/master/data_reports/p_vs_n/comparison.jpg" alt="p_vs_n"></p>

<p>This graph show the number of positive articles vs negative articles for a single company on a single day. The purple '+' signs are days that were guessed correctly and the blue 'x' signs are days that were predicted incorrectly. Note that it is possible to have multiple points at the same location. The interesting observation with this graph is that the days that were predicted incorrectly are contained in the region where negative articles out weight the positive articles. This means that the Press Analyzer is more likely to predict false negative and false positives.</p>

<h3>
<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I believe that this project was a valid proof of concept for to suggest that there is a correlation between sentiment of articles and stock prices of a company. This initial finding of show that further work on this subject should be done to improve the accuracy of the Press Analyzer. There are three areas of this project that I believe could be refactored to achieve better accuracy.</p>

<p>First, use more than a single metric for determining sentiment of an article. I believe that making use of other functionality contained in the NLTK would be well suited for a commitee of experts to determine the sentiment more accurately.</p>

<p>Second, I believe that it would be prudent to determine positive and negative days with respect to the market as well. This would help to smooth out presures from the market that are not nessesarily directly corralated to a company of interest. In other words if the entire market is going down then the relative change in a company would be measured with respect to the overall market change.</p>

<p>Third, I would like to see if there in a correlation, either possitive or negative, between companies. In this way I could extrapolite reponses for partnering and competing companies to predict stock trends for them without directly analyzing articles about their company.</p>

<p>Fourth, look at stock values multiple times per day. Currently the I am able to pull: low, hight, open and close for each day on the stock market. I would be interested to see smaller time intervals.</p>

<p>I am very happy with how this project turned out. I am glad that I have identified location that need improvement. Some of these location didn't occure to me at the time when I first created the Press Analyzer. This project was valuable to learn a lot about the stock market and the things that influence it. I am excited to work on this again and improve the correlation that I am seeing between article sentiment and predicting stock trends. In the meantime the Press Analyzer will continue to gather data and hopefully improve it's decision making skills and uncover more interesting stock correlations.</p>
