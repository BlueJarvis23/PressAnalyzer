This project is an attempt to correlate the sentiment of an arbitrary article about a company to stock trends of that company. Work done on this project is intended at be a proof of concept that can confirm or contradict the validity of such a correlation.

### Project Overview
I am interested in using AI to follow trends of data, specifically, the trends of the stock market. I believe that a less common approach to this problem is to try and model the stimulants of the stock market instead of past data trends. My vision for this project is to use AI techniques to determine market reactions to company's press releases and articles such as product reviews. For example, it is not uncommon to have the stock market react in a volatile fashion after a company reports it’s quarterly earnings. Sometimes the press release that is positive for one company will also affect a competitors company in a negative fashion. For example if a company comes out with a new product that outperforms the current trend-setter their stock will rise but their competitor’s stock will drop even if the press release does not mention the competitor by name. I would like to create a system that can look for these subtle connections and, if possible, correctly predict stock market trends.

In thinking about creating this press release analyzer I tried to break it down into a manageable initial task. Initially, I believe it will be important to determine the tone of a particular article, ex. Is the article positive or negative? This is the current topic of this project. If the correlation of article sentiment and stocks can be shown to be plausible then connections between companies can be added at a later time.

### Project Purpose
Hopefully throughout the course of this project a positive correlation can be shown. This could be the basis of further research and development of new systems to analyze and predict stocks. Preliminary tests indicate that given sufficient training samples that  the system is able to predict sentiment of articles with higher accuracy. Because the accuracy is being measured using stock market averages the initial results appear to be quite promising.
